# Data Persistence Fixes - v0.16.0 / v2.0.0

**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Branch:** sandbox-v0.7.1  
**Frontend Version:** 0.16.0  
**Backend Version:** 2.0.0 (Major version bump due to critical data persistence fixes)  

## 🎯 Overview

Fixed critical data persistence issues across the application where information was not being saved or preserved throughout the workflow. These fixes ensure all user data is properly stored, updated, and displayed.

---

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Event Participants Dropdown Empty

**Problem:**
- 5 users visible in Users tab
- No users appearing in dropdown when adding participants to events
- Only loading from localStorage, not from API

**Root Cause:**
`EventSetup.tsx` was only loading users from `localStorage`, not from the server API when `api.USE_SERVER` was true.

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Before (lines 44-46)
const storedUsers = localStorage.getItem('tradeshow_users');
if (storedUsers) setAllUsers(JSON.parse(storedUsers));

// After (lines 37-38)
const users = await api.getUsers();
setAllUsers(users || []);
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/events/EventSetup.tsx` (lines 31-50)

---

### Issue 2: Event Dates Not Persisting After Edit

**Problem:**
- Budget saves correctly when editing an event
- Start Date and End Date fields reset after update
- Date format mismatch between API response and date input fields

**Root Cause:**
Date values from the API (ISO 8601 format) were not being properly converted to the `YYYY-MM-DD` format required by HTML date inputs.

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Added date formatting function (lines 127-131)
const formatDateForInput = (dateString: string) => {
  const date = new Date(dateString);
  return date.toISOString().split('T')[0];
};

// Applied to startDate and endDate (lines 138-139)
startDate: formatDateForInput(event.startDate),
endDate: formatDateForInput(event.endDate),
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/events/EventSetup.tsx` (lines 125-144)

---

### Issue 3: Expense Submission - Missing Event and Card Data

**Problem:**
- Receipts not saved/linked to expense entries
- Event (tradeShowId) not saved when updating expenses
- Card used not persisting to database
- Database not storing or displaying receipts

**Root Cause:**
Frontend was not sending `event_id` when updating expenses (only sending it on create). Backend was not accepting `event_id` in update route.

**Fix - Frontend:**
```typescript
// Before (lines 50-60)
await api.updateExpense(editingExpense.id, {
  category: expenseData.category,
  merchant: expenseData.merchant,
  // ... no event_id
});

// After (lines 50-61)
await api.updateExpense(editingExpense.id, {
  event_id: expenseData.tradeShowId, // FIXED: Include event_id on update
  category: expenseData.category,
  merchant: expenseData.merchant,
  // ...
});
```

**Fix - Backend:**
```typescript
// Before
const { category, merchant, amount, ... } = req.body; // no event_id

// After (line 439)
const { event_id, category, merchant, amount, ... } = req.body;

// Updated SQL queries to include event_id (lines 463-477)
SET event_id = $1, category = $2, merchant = $3, ...
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/expenses/ExpenseSubmission.tsx` (line 51)
- `backend/src/routes/expenses.ts` (lines 439, 463-477)

---

### Issue 4: Edit Expense - Receipt Re-upload Wipes Event and Card

**Problem:**
- After re-uploading receipt while editing expense
- Previously selected event reset to empty
- Previously selected card reset to empty
- All field data lost when uploading new receipt

**Root Cause:**
The `handleReceiptUpload` function in `ExpenseForm.tsx` was auto-filling OCR data but not preserving the existing `tradeShowId` and `cardUsed` values.

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Before (lines 178-185)
setFormData(prev => ({
  ...prev,
  merchant: prev.merchant || extractedData.merchant,
  amount: prev.amount || extractedData.amount,
  // ... missing tradeShowId and cardUsed preservation
}));

// After (lines 178-188)
setFormData(prev => ({
  ...prev,
  merchant: prev.merchant || extractedData.merchant,
  amount: prev.amount || extractedData.amount,
  date: prev.date || extractedData.date,
  ocrText: extractedData.ocrText,
  category: prev.category || category,
  // FIXED: Preserve tradeShowId and cardUsed when re-uploading receipt
  tradeShowId: prev.tradeShowId, // Keep existing event selection
  cardUsed: prev.cardUsed // Keep existing card selection
}));
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/expenses/ExpenseForm.tsx` (lines 186-187)
