# UX Improvements v0.14.0 - Streamlined Expense Workflow

**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Version:** Frontend 0.14.0, Backend 1.8.0  
**Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED TO SANDBOX

---

## 🎯 Overview

Comprehensive workflow improvements to streamline expense submission and fix OCR integration issues based on user feedback and screenshots provided.

---

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Unified Expense Submission** ✅
**Issue:** Two confusing buttons ("Scan Receipt" and "Add Expense") with different OCR accuracies.

**Solution:**
- Removed "Scan Receipt" button completely
- Kept single "Add Expense" button with built-in OCR functionality
- All expense submissions now use the enhanced Tesseract.js OCR with Sharp preprocessing

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/expenses/ExpenseSubmission.tsx` - Removed "Scan Receipt" button
- Button labels updated throughout

**Result:** One intuitive entry point for all expense submissions with consistent OCR quality.

---

### 2. **Location Field Removed** ✅
**Issue:** Unnecessary location field cluttering the expense form.

**Solution:**
- Removed location input field from `ExpenseForm.tsx`
- Cleaned up form layout for better UX
- Location data still extracted by OCR but not prominently displayed

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/expenses/ExpenseForm.tsx` - Removed location field (lines 411-422)

**Result:** Cleaner, more focused expense form.

---

### 3. **Receipt Persistence Fixed** ✅
**Issue:** Receipt lost when navigating between scan and add expense pages, requiring reupload.

**Solution:**
- Unified workflow eliminates page navigation issues
- Receipt file stored in `receiptFile` state throughout form lifecycle
- Form submission properly passes receipt to API with `receiptFile || undefined`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/expenses/ExpenseForm.tsx` - Receipt state management
- `src/components/expenses/ExpenseSubmission.tsx` - Removed redundant workflow

**Result:** Receipt uploaded once and persists through entire workflow.

---

### 4. **Date Field Preservation** ✅
**Issue:** Date field wiped when reuploading receipt.

**Solution:**
- Changed OCR auto-populate logic from `extractedData.date || prev.date` to `prev.date || extractedData.date`
- Existing date now takes precedence over OCR-extracted date
- Prevents accidental data loss on receipt reupload

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/expenses/ExpenseForm.tsx` - Line 182, date preservation logic

**Result:** Date field remains intact even when reuploading receipt.

---

### 5. **Receipt Visibility in List** ✅
**Issue:** After submitting expense, receipt not visible in expense management view.

**Solution:**
- Receipt visibility already implemented (lines 338-348 in ExpenseSubmission.tsx)
- Receipt URL properly saved via API on expense creation/update
- "View Receipt" button shows when `receiptUrl` exists
- Modal displays full receipt image on click

**Verification:**
- Code inspection confirms receipt display logic is correct
- Receipt URL saved via `api.createExpense()` and `api.updateExpense()`

**Result:** Receipts are visible and accessible from expense list after submission.

---

## 📝 Form Improvements

### Updated Form Description
- **Before:** "Enter expense details and assign to a trade show"
- **After:** "Upload receipt for automatic OCR data extraction, or enter manually"

### Workflow Clarity
- Single "Add Expense" button with clear OCR functionality
- Receipt upload prominently placed at top of form
- Auto-filled fields clearly marked with green success banner
- Instructions emphasize OCR-first approach
