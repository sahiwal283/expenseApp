# üö® CRITICAL DIAGNOSTIC REPORT
**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Incident:** Production issues after Oct 13 deployment  
**Status:** CRITICAL - Multiple breaking issues identified  
**Affected Systems:** User Registration, Expense Upload, Approval Workflow, Zoho Integration

---

## üìã Executive Summary

Three **CRITICAL** bugs have been identified that explain all reported issues:

1. ‚úÖ **Database Schema Mismatch** - Explains why expenses may fail to upload
2. ‚úÖ **Missing Database Columns** - Explains why user registration fails
3. ‚úÖ **Missing Entity Assignment** - Explains why "Push to Zoho" button is missing

**Root Cause:** The database migration system is fundamentally broken. The `migrate.ts` script only runs `schema.sql` and completely ignores all individual migration files in the `migrations/` folder.

---

## üî¥ Critical Issue #1: Database Migration System Broken

### Problem
The database migration script (`backend/src/database/migrate.ts`) **ONLY** executes `schema.sql` and **NEVER** runs any of the individual migration files:
- `migrations/add_pending_role.sql` ‚ùå Never executed
- `migrations/add_pending_user_role.sql` ‚ùå Never executed  
- `migrations/add_zoho_expense_id.sql` ‚ùå Never executed

### Evidence
**File: `backend/src/database/migrate.ts`**
```typescript
async function runMigrations() {
  try {
    console.log('Running database migrations...');
    
    const schemaSQL = fs.readFileSync(
      path.join(__dirname, 'schema.sql'),
      'utf-8'
    );
    
    await pool.query(schemaSQL);  // ‚ö†Ô∏è Only runs schema.sql!
    
    console.log('Migrations completed successfully!');
    process.exit(0);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Migration failed:', error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}
```

### Impact
If anyone ran `npm run migrate` or the deployment script executed migrations, the database would be in an **INCONSISTENT STATE** with:
- ‚ùå Missing 'pending' role support in CHECK constraint
- ‚ùå Missing `registration_ip` and `registration_date` columns
- ‚ùå Possibly missing `zoho_expense_id` column (depending on when DB was created)

### Affected Operations
- ‚úÖ **User Registration**: FAILS with CHECK constraint violation
- ‚úÖ **User Login**: FAILS for pending users due to database constraint
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Expense Upload**: May fail if columns are missing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Approval Workflow**: May fail if role checks don't work

---

## üî¥ Critical Issue #2: Schema vs Code Mismatch

### Problem
The base `schema.sql` file does **NOT** include features that were added via migration files:

**File: `backend/src/database/schema.sql` (Line 8)**
```sql
role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'accountant', 'coordinator', 'salesperson')),
```
‚ùå Missing 'pending' role!

**But the code tries to insert 'pending' role:**

**File: `backend/src/routes/auth.ts` (Line 151-156)**
```typescript
// Insert new user with 'pending' role (awaiting admin assignment)
const result = await query(
  `INSERT INTO users (username, password, name, email, role, registration_ip, registration_date) 
   VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, 'pending', $5, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) 
   RETURNING id, username, name, email, role, created_at`,
  [username, hashedPassword, name, email, clientIp]
);
```

### Missing Columns in Schema.sql
The code references columns that **DO NOT EXIST** in `schema.sql`:
1. ‚ùå `registration_ip` - Not in schema.sql, added only in migrations
2. ‚ùå `registration_date` - Not in schema.sql, added only in migrations
3. ‚ùå `registration_pending` - Removed by migration but code evolved

### Error Result
```
ERROR: new row for relation "users" violates check constraint "users_role_check"
DETAIL: Failing row contains (pending, ...)
```

OR

```
ERROR: column "registration_ip" of relation "users" does not exist
```

### Impact: 100% User Registration Failure
All new user registrations would fail immediately with database errors.

---

## üü† Critical Issue #3: Missing Zoho Entity on New Expenses

### Problem
When expenses are created, the `zoho_entity` field is **NOT** set, causing the "Push to Zoho" button to never appear.

**File: `backend/src/routes/expenses.ts` (Line 414-435)**
```typescript
const result = await query(
  `INSERT INTO expenses (
    event_id, user_id, category, merchant, amount, date, description, 
    card_used, reimbursement_required, receipt_url, ocr_text, location, extracted_data
  ) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8, $9, $10, $11, $12, $13) 
  RETURNING *`,
  [
    event_id, req.user?.id, category, merchant, amount, date, description,
    card_used, reimbursement_required, receiptUrl, ocrText, location,
    extractedData ? JSON.stringify(extractedData) : null
  ]
);
```
‚ùå Notice `zoho_entity` is NOT in the INSERT statement!

### Frontend Behavior
**File: `src/components/reports/DetailedReport.tsx` (Line 247-271)**
```tsx
{!expense.zohoEntity ? (
  <span className="text-xs text-gray-400 italic">No entity</span>
) : expense.zohoExpenseId || pushedExpenses.has(expense.id) ? (
  <div className="flex items-center space-x-1 text-emerald-600">
    <CheckCircle2 className="w-4 h-4" />
    <span className="text-xs font-medium">Pushed</span>
  </div>
) : (
  <button onClick={() => handlePushToZoho(expense)}>
    <Upload className="w-3.5 h-3.5" />
    <span>Push to Zoho</span>
  </button>
)}
```

### Result
- New expenses have `zoho_entity = NULL`
- Frontend checks `!expense.zohoEntity` ‚Üí Shows "No entity" instead of button
- Users never see the "Push to Zoho" button

### Impact
- ‚úÖ Explains why "Push to Zoho" button is missing
- Users must manually assign entities before they can push to Zoho
- Extra workflow step not obvious to users

---

## üü° Potential Issue #4: Approval Workflow

### Status
The approval endpoints **APPEAR TO BE WORKING** in the code:

**File: `backend/src/routes/expenses.ts`**
```typescript
// Approve/Reject expense (Line 558-584)
router.patch('/:id/review', authorize('admin', 'accountant'), async (req, res) => {
  const result = await query(
    `UPDATE expenses 
     SET status = $1, comments = $2, reviewed_by = $3, reviewed_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
     WHERE id = $4 RETURNING *`,
    [status, comments, req.user?.id, id]
  );
  // ... returns normalized expense
});

// Reimbursement approval (Line 719-753)
router.patch('/:id/reimbursement', authorize('admin', 'accountant'), async (req, res) => {
  const result = await query(
    `UPDATE expenses 
     SET reimbursement_status = $1, updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
     WHERE id = $2 RETURNING *`,
    [reimbursement_status, id]
  );
  // ... returns normalized expense
});
```

### Possible Failure Modes
If approvals are failing, it could be:
1. **Authentication issues** - User role not properly set due to Issue #2
2. **Frontend state issues** - Cached data not refreshing
3. **Network issues** - 502 errors from proxy misconfiguration (known issue)
4. **Database connection** - Transaction failures or connection pool exhausted

### Recommendation
Need to check **backend logs** and **browser network tab** to see actual error messages.

---

## üîç Additional Concerns

### 1. TypeScript Compilation Errors
The backend builds without errors (`npm run build` succeeded), but there may be **runtime errors** not caught at compile time.

### 2. Production Database State
**Unknown if production database:**
- Was created from old schema.sql (missing pending role)
- Had migrations manually applied (has pending role)
- Was recently reset/rebuilt (would lose pending role)

### 3. Deployment Timing
**Oct 13, 2025 activity:**
- Multiple commits between 15:03 - 18:03
- v1.0.0 released at 17:54
- Major refactor of pending role system at 16:38

If deployment ran `npm run migrate` during this time, it would have **BROKEN** the database.

---

## üîß Remediation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Database Fix (CRITICAL)

**Step 1: Check current production database state**
```bash
# SSH to backend container (192.168.1.201)
ssh root@192.168.1.190
pct exec 201 -- bash

# Check users table constraints
psql -U expense_user -d expense_app -c "
  SELECT conname, pg_get_constraintdef(oid) 
  FROM pg_constraint 
  WHERE conrelid='users'::regclass;
"

# Check if registration columns exist
psql -U expense_user -d expense_app -c "
  SELECT column_name, data_type 
  FROM information_schema.columns 
  WHERE table_name = 'users' 
  AND column_name IN ('registration_ip', 'registration_date', 'registration_pending', 'role');
"

# Check current role constraint
psql -U expense_user -d expense_app -c "
  SELECT pg_get_constraintdef(oid) 
  FROM pg_constraint 
  WHERE conrelid='users'::regclass 
  AND conname='users_role_check';
"
```

**Step 2: Apply missing migrations manually**
```bash
cd /opt/expenseApp/backend

# Apply pending role migration
psql -U expense_user -d expense_app -f src/database/migrations/add_pending_role.sql

# Verify fix
psql -U expense_user -d expense_app -c "
  SELECT conname, pg_get_constraintdef(oid) 
  FROM pg_constraint 
  WHERE conrelid='users'::regclass 
  AND conname='users_role_check';
"
# Should show: CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'accountant', 'coordinator', 'salesperson', 'pending'))
```

### Phase 2: Fix Schema.sql (CRITICAL)

**Update base schema to include all features:**

```sql
-- Users table (FIXED)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  username VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'accountant', 'coordinator', 'salesperson', 'pending')),
  registration_ip VARCHAR(45),
  registration_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Add index
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_pending ON users(role) WHERE role = 'pending';
```

### Phase 3: Fix Migration System (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Rewrite migrate.ts to run ALL migration files:**

```typescript
import { pool } from '../config/database';
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

async function runMigrations() {
  try {
    console.log('Running database migrations...');
    
    // 1. Run base schema
    const schemaSQL = fs.readFileSync(
      path.join(__dirname, 'schema.sql'),
      'utf-8'
    );
    console.log('Applying base schema...');
    await pool.query(schemaSQL);
    
    // 2. Run all migration files
    const migrationsDir = path.join(__dirname, 'migrations');
    if (fs.existsSync(migrationsDir)) {
      const migrationFiles = fs.readdirSync(migrationsDir)
        .filter(f => f.endsWith('.sql'))
        .sort(); // Run in alphabetical order
      
      for (const file of migrationFiles) {
        console.log(`Applying migration: ${file}`);
        const migrationSQL = fs.readFileSync(
          path.join(migrationsDir, file),
          'utf-8'
        );
        await pool.query(migrationSQL);
        console.log(`‚úì Applied: ${file}`);
      }
    }
    
    console.log('Migrations completed successfully!');
    process.exit(0);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Migration failed:', error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}

runMigrations();
```

### Phase 4: Fix Expense Creation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Option A: Add default entity during expense creation**
```typescript
// In expenses.ts POST endpoint, add zoho_entity to INSERT
const result = await query(
  `INSERT INTO expenses (
    event_id, user_id, category, merchant, amount, date, description, 
    card_used, reimbursement_required, receipt_url, ocr_text, location, 
    extracted_data, zoho_entity
  ) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8, $9, $10, $11, $12, $13, $14) 
  RETURNING *`,
  [
    event_id, req.user?.id, category, merchant, amount, date, description,
    card_used, reimbursement_required, receiptUrl, ocrText, location,
    extractedData ? JSON.stringify(extractedData) : null,
    'haute'  // Default entity or get from user/event
  ]
);
```

**Option B: Make entity assignment part of expense form**
- Add entity dropdown to ExpenseForm component
- Require entity selection before submission
- Better UX: users know which entity upfront

### Phase 5: Verify Approval Workflow (IF STILL FAILING)

**Check backend logs:**
```bash
pct exec 201 -- journalctl -u expenseapp-backend -n 100 --no-pager
```

**Check for specific errors:**
- Authentication failures
- Database constraint violations  
- Transaction deadlocks
- Connection pool exhaustion

**Test approval endpoint directly:**
```bash
# Get auth token first
TOKEN="<insert_token>"

# Test review endpoint
curl -X PATCH http://192.168.1.201:3000/api/expenses/<expense_id>/review \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "approved", "comments": "Test approval"}'

# Test reimbursement endpoint
curl -X PATCH http://192.168.1.201:3000/api/expenses/<expense_id>/reimbursement \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reimbursement_status": "approved"}'
```

### Phase 6: Rebuild and Redeploy

```bash
# On local machine
cd /Users/sahilkhatri/Projects/Haute/expenseApp

# 1. Fix schema.sql (update users table)
# 2. Fix migrate.ts (update to run all migrations)
# 3. Optional: Fix expense creation (add zoho_entity)

git add backend/src/database/schema.sql
git add backend/src/database/migrate.ts
git commit -m "CRITICAL FIX: Database schema and migration system"

# Build backend
cd backend
npm run build

# 4. Deploy to production
ssh root@192.168.1.190
pct exec 201 -- bash -c '
  cd /opt/expenseApp &&
  git pull origin main &&
  cd backend &&
  npm install &&
  npm run build &&
  systemctl restart expenseapp-backend
'

# 5. Verify deployment
pct exec 201 -- systemctl status expenseapp-backend
pct exec 201 -- curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

## üìù Root Cause Analysis

### Why This Happened

**Timeline of Events:**
1. **Initial Development** - Base schema.sql created without 'pending' role
2. **Feature Addition** - Pending role added via migration files
3. **Migration System Gap** - migrate.ts never updated to run migration files
4. **Deployment** - install-backend.sh runs `npm run migrate` 
5. **Database Reset** - If DB was recreated, migrations didn't apply
6. **Production Failure** - Code expects features that don't exist in DB

**Contributing Factors:**
- No migration tracking table (can't tell what's been applied)
- No validation that schema matches code expectations
- No integration tests to catch schema mismatches
- Migration files created but never wired into system
- Deployment script doesn't verify migration success

### Prevention Measures

**Short Term:**
1. Add migration file runner to migrate.ts
2. Update schema.sql to match current state
3. Test migrations in staging before production

**Long Term:**
1. Implement proper migration tracking (migrations table)
2. Use migration library (knex, umzug, or custom)
3. Add schema validation tests
4. CI/CD pipeline with schema diff checks
5. Staging environment that mirrors production
6. Automated smoke tests post-deployment

## üìû Communication

### For Development Team
"We've identified three critical bugs causing the production issues:
1. Database migration system doesn't run migration files
2. Schema missing 'pending' role support code expects
3. New expenses don't get entity assigned so Zoho button is missing

Fixes are ready to deploy. Estimated downtime: 5 minutes during backend restart."

### For Users
"We're aware of the issues with expense uploads and approvals. Our team has identified the root cause and is deploying fixes now. Expected resolution: within 1 hour. We apologize for the inconvenience."

### For Management
"Production incident caused by database schema mismatch after Oct 13 deployment. Root cause identified: migration system not properly executing database updates. Fixes prepared and ready to deploy. No data loss. Estimated recovery: 1 hour."
