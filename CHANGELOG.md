# Changelog

All notable changes to the ExpenseApp will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.2] - 2025-10-16 (Frontend v1.3.2 / Backend v1.3.1)
**Branch: v1.2.0 (Sandbox Only)**

### Added
- **Editable Status/Reimbursement/Entity in Expense Detail Modal**:
  - Approval users (admin, accountant, developer) can now edit Status, Reimbursement, and Entity directly from the detail modal
  - **Status Dropdown**: Pending / Approved / Rejected
  - **Reimbursement Dropdown**: Pending Review / Approved / Rejected (shown only when reimbursement is required)
  - **Entity Dropdown**: Unassigned / Haute Brands / Boomin
  - Changes save immediately with toast notifications
  - Confirmation dialog when changing entity for expenses already pushed to Zoho
  - Regular users continue to see read-only status badges

### Changed
- **Database Configuration**: Updated sandbox `entityOptions` to `["Haute Brands", "Boomin"]` (previously had placeholder values)

### Fixed
- Removed debug console.logs from `useExpenses` hook

### Technical Details
- Modified `ExpenseSubmission.tsx` detail modal (lines 854-982)
- Conditional rendering: dropdowns for approval users, badges for regular users
- Inline async handlers for immediate save on dropdown change
- Entity change includes warning if `zohoExpenseId` exists and entity is changing

### UX Improvements
- **Streamlined Workflow**: No need to close detail modal and enter edit mode to change status/reimbursement/entity
- **Visual Clarity**: Dropdowns have colored focus rings matching their purpose (purple for status, orange for reimbursement, blue for entity)
- **Safety**: Confirmation prompt prevents accidental entity changes for Zoho-synced expenses

## [1.3.1] - 2025-10-16 (Frontend v1.3.1 / Backend v1.3.1)
**Branch: v1.2.0 (Sandbox Only)**

### Fixed
- **Entity Dropdown Display Issue**: Fixed entity dropdown not showing assigned entity values
  - Added fallback logic to ensure assigned entity is always available in dropdown options
  - Prevents blank dropdown when entity is assigned but not yet in `entityOptions` array
  - Dropdown now correctly shows "Haute Brands", "Boomin", etc. when assigned
  - Maintains disabled state for already-assigned entities

### Changed
- **Version Numbering**: Corrected version from 1.2.1 ‚Üí 1.3.1 to maintain proper semantic versioning
  - Version numbers should always increment forward, never backwards
  - Users had already seen v1.3.0 in sandbox, so incremented to 1.3.1

### Technical Details
- Modified entity dropdown rendering in `ExpenseSubmission.tsx` to include current `expense.zohoEntity` as an option even if it's not in the `entityOptions` array
- This handles race conditions where expenses load before settings, or when entities are archived/removed from settings

## [1.2.1] - 2025-10-16 (Frontend v1.2.1 / Backend v1.2.1)
**Branch: v1.2.0-dev-dashboard-fixes (Sandbox Only)**

### üéØ Major Feature: Unified Expense & Approval Workflows

**Note:** The separate "Approvals" tab has been removed. All approval workflows are now integrated directly into the "Expenses" page.

### Added

  - Regular users (salesperson, coordinator, temporary) see only their own expenses (unchanged behavior)
  - Approval users (admin, accountant, developer) now see **ALL user expenses** plus approval workflow cards
  
- **Approval Workflow Cards (Admin/Accountant/Developer Only)**:
  - **Pending Approval Card**: Shows count and total amount of expenses awaiting approval
  - **Reimbursements Card**: Shows count of reimbursements pending approval
  - **Unassigned Entities Card**: Shows count of expenses needing entity assignment
  - Cards display at top of Expenses page for quick status overview

- **Enhanced Expense Table (Approval Users Only)**:
  - **User Column**: Shows who submitted each expense
  - **Entity Column**: Dropdown to assign/change Zoho entity
  - **Zoho Column**: Button to push expenses to Zoho Books, with "Pushed" status indicator
  - **Approval Actions**: Approve/Reject buttons for pending expenses (inline with each row)
  - **Reimbursement Actions**: Approve/Reject buttons for pending reimbursements
  - All existing columns remain for regular users

- **Smart Permission-Based Filtering**:
  - Approval users see all expenses from all users
  - Regular users continue to see only their own expenses
  - Delete button only appears for user's own expenses

### Changed
- **Navigation**:
  - Removed "Approvals" tab from sidebar (no longer needed)
  - "Expenses" tab now serves both regular expense submission AND approval workflows
  - Page subtitle changes based on user role:
    - Regular users: "Submit and track your trade show expenses"
    - Approval users: "Review, approve, and manage expense submissions"

- **Enhanced Data Fetching**:
  - `useExpenses` hook now optionally fetches users and entity options for approval workflows
  - More efficient data loading based on user permissions

### Fixed
- Delete expense button now only shows for user's own expenses (not for other users' expenses)

### Technical Details

- **Developer Role Now Has Full Admin Capabilities**:
  - Developers can now create, edit, and delete users
  - Developers can now create, edit, and delete roles
  - Developer role has access to all admin features PLUS Dev Dashboard
  - Maintains separation: admins don't see Dev Dashboard

### Fixed
- **Role Dropdown Now Loads Dynamically from Database**:
  - Edit User modal: All roles from database now appear (was hardcoded to 4)
  - Filter Role dropdown: All active roles load dynamically
  - Activation modal: All roles load dynamically
  - Automatically filters out 'pending' role (used only for new registrations)
  - No more missing roles in dropdowns!

### Backend (v1.0.23)

  - Added `roles` state to store dynamic role list
  - Calls `api.getRoles()` on component mount
  - Replaced 3 hardcoded role `<option>` lists with dynamic mapping
  - Filters out 'pending' role from admin-facing dropdowns

### Technical
- Backend checks now use `user.role !== 'admin' && user.role !== 'developer'`
- Frontend maps roles: `roles.map(role => <option key={role.id} value={role.name}>{role.label}</option>)`
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## [1.0.55] - 2025-10-15 (Frontend v1.0.55 / Backend v1.0.22)

### Changed
- **Role Management UX Improvements**:
  - Moved Role Management section below User Management
  - Made Role Management collapsible (collapsed by default)
  - Chevron up/down indicator for collapse state

  - System roles (admin, accountant, coordinator, salesperson, developer, temporary, pending) cannot be deleted
  - Validation: Can't delete roles that are currently assigned to users
  
### Backend
- **New Database Table: `roles`**:
  - Migration `003_create_roles_table.sql` creates roles table
  - Stores role metadata: name, label, description, color, is_system, is_active
  - Automatically inserts all existing system roles
  - Removes hardcoded CHECK constraint on users.role column
  - Indexes added for performance (name, is_active, is_system)
  - Automatic updated_at timestamp trigger

- **New API Endpoints: `/api/roles`**:
  - `GET /api/roles` - Fetch all active roles
  - `POST /api/roles` - Create new role (admin only)
  - `PUT /api/roles/:id` - Update role (admin only, limited for system roles)
  - `DELETE /api/roles/:id` - Soft delete role (admin only, system roles protected)
  - Role name validation (lowercase, underscores for spaces)

- Transaction safety for role operations
- Error messages explain why operations fail

## [1.0.53] - 2025-10-15 (Frontend)

### Added
- **Push to Zoho Button on Approvals Page**:
  - Moved "Push to Zoho" functionality from Reports page to Approvals page
  - New "Zoho" column added after "Entity" column in the approvals table
  - Button only appears when expense has an entity assigned
  - Shows "No entity" if entity not assigned yet

  - Improved workflow: Assign entity ‚Üí Approve ‚Üí Push to Zoho (all in one place)
  
### Changed
- **Improved Approval UX**:
  - Approvals page is now the central hub for expense processing
  - No need to switch to Reports page to push expenses to Zoho Books
  - Entity assignment and Zoho sync happen in the same workflow
  - More intuitive: approve the expense, then push it immediately

### Technical
- Added `handlePushToZoho` function to Approvals component
- Added `pushingExpenseId` and `pushedExpenses` state management
- Added Upload, Loader2, CheckCircle2 icons to Approvals imports
- Table now has 9 columns (was 8): added "Zoho" column

## [1.0.50] - 2025-10-15 (Frontend) / Backend 1.0.21

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Custom Event Participants Not Saving (Database Constraint Violation)**:
  - **Root cause:** Database CHECK constraint didn't include `'temporary'` role
  - Database only allowed: admin, accountant, coordinator, salesperson, developer, pending
  - Application code was trying to INSERT users with `role = 'temporary'`
  - PostgreSQL rejected with: "violates check constraint users_role_check"
  - **What I forgot:** In v1.0.47, added 'temporary' to frontend/backend code but not database schema
  - **Solution:** Created migration `002_add_temporary_role.sql` to add 'temporary' to constraint
  - Migration deployed and run successfully on sandbox

- **Event Creation Strategy Changed to "Best Effort"**:
  - **Old behavior:** Transaction (all-or-nothing) - if any participant failed, entire event rolled back
  - **User feedback:** "I don't mind that it created the event, but I don't like the error"
  - **New behavior:** Event always created, participants processed individually
  - If one participant fails, skip it and continue with others
  - Better logging: ‚úì for success, ‚ö†Ô∏è for failures
  - `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` prevents duplicate participant errors

### Added
- **Database Migration** `002_add_temporary_role.sql`:
  - Drops old `users_role_check` constraint
  - Adds new constraint including 'temporary' role
  - Now allows: admin, accountant, coordinator, salesperson, developer, pending, **temporary**

### Backend Changes (v1.0.21)
- `database/migrations/002_add_temporary_role.sql` (NEW):
  - Adds 'temporary' to allowed roles in CHECK constraint
- `routes/events.ts`:
  - Removed transaction wrapper for participant handling
  - Each participant now processed in try/catch block
  - Event creation never fails due to participant errors
  - Added `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` for duplicate participants
  - Enhanced logging for debugging

### Impact
- ‚úÖ Custom participants now save successfully
- ‚úÖ Database accepts 'temporary' role
- ‚úÖ Events created even if some participants fail
- ‚úÖ No more "Failed to save event" errors for temp users
- ‚úÖ Better user experience (no blocking errors)
- ‚úÖ Clear logging for troubleshooting

## [1.0.49] - 2025-10-15 (Frontend) / Backend 1.0.20

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Event Creation Without Participants (Transaction Bug)**:
  - **Root cause:** Event inserted first, then participants added after
  - If participant insertion failed, event already existed in database (no rollback)
  - User saw error but event was saved anyway ‚Üí orphaned events
  - **Example:** Create event with duplicate email ‚Üí event created, participant failed, no rollback
  - **Solution:** Wrapped entire operation in database transaction (BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK)
  - All-or-nothing behavior: event + participants or nothing
  - Both CREATE and UPDATE routes now use transactions
  - Added extensive logging for debugging transaction flow

- **Better Error Messages for Event Creation**:
  - Now returns specific errors based on PostgreSQL error codes:
    - `23505` (Unique constraint): "A user with that email or username already exists"
    - `23503` (Foreign key): "Invalid participant ID provided"
    - Generic: "Failed to create event. Please try again."
  - Helps users understand what went wrong

- **Version Display Not Dynamic**:
  - **Root cause:** Version was hardcoded in devDashboard.ts (1.0.48)
  - Had to manually update every deployment, easy to forget
  - **Solution:** Dev dashboard now reads from backend package.json
  - Frontend and backend versions kept in sync (incremented together)
  - One source of truth: backend package.json version

### Backend Changes (v1.0.20)
- `routes/events.ts`:
  - Imported `pool` from database config for transaction support
  - POST route: Uses `pool.connect()` to get client for transaction
  - `BEGIN` before any inserts, `COMMIT` if all succeed, `ROLLBACK` on error
  - PUT route: Also uses transactions for event updates
  - Added transaction logging: "Starting transaction", "Committed", "Rolled back"
  - Added participant creation logging for debugging
  - Better error handling with specific messages per error code
- `routes/devDashboard.ts`:
  - Removed hardcoded version string
  - Now reads `pkg.version` from backend package.json
  - `frontendVersion = backendVersion` (kept in sync)

### Impact
- ‚úÖ Events only created if ALL participants added successfully
- ‚úÖ No more orphaned events without participants
- ‚úÖ Clear, actionable error messages
- ‚úÖ Version display always accurate (no manual updates needed)
- ‚úÖ Better debugging with transaction logs
- ‚úÖ Atomic database operations (all-or-nothing)

## [1.0.48] - 2025-10-15 (Frontend) / Backend 1.0.19

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Developer Role Cannot Update Events**:
  - **Root cause:** Backend PUT `/api/events/:id` only allowed `admin` and `coordinator` roles
  - Developer could CREATE events but got 403 Forbidden when trying to UPDATE/EDIT
  - **Solution:** Added `'developer'` to PUT route authorization
  - Developer can now both create and update events

- **Custom Participants Not Working for Event Updates**:
  - **Root cause:** PUT route only handled `participant_ids` (array of IDs)
  - When editing with custom participants, frontend sent full objects
  - Backend tried to insert non-existent user IDs ‚Üí foreign key constraint
  - **Solution:** Updated PUT route to handle both `participants` and `participant_ids`
  - Same logic as POST: check if user exists, create if needed
  - Frontend sends full participant objects for both create AND update

- **Dev Dashboard Showing Wrong Version**:
  - Showed Frontend: 1.0.7 instead of 1.0.48
  - **Root cause:** Backend trying to read frontend `package.json` from non-existent path
  - Frontend package.json not deployed to server (only used at build time)
  - **Solution:** Hardcoded frontend version in devDashboard.ts
  - Now correctly displays 1.0.48 (matches actual deployed version)
  - TODO: Make dynamic via environment variable

### Backend Changes (v1.0.19)
- `routes/events.ts`:
  - Added `'developer'` to PUT route: `authorize('admin', 'coordinator', 'developer')`
  - Added custom participant handling to UPDATE route (same as CREATE)
  - Checks if participant user exists, creates with default password if needed
  - Handles both `participants` (full objects) and `participant_ids` (legacy format)
- `routes/devDashboard.ts`:
  - Fixed version endpoint to show correct frontend version
  - Removed attempt to read non-existent frontend package.json

### Frontend Changes
- `events/EventSetup/hooks/useEventForm.ts`:
  - Changed UPDATE to send `participants` instead of `participant_ids`
  - Consistent with CREATE endpoint
  - Enables custom participants for event updates

### Impact
- ‚úÖ Developer role can now edit events without 403 errors
- ‚úÖ Custom participants work for both creating and updating events
- ‚úÖ Dev dashboard displays accurate version information
- ‚úÖ Consistent permission model across all event operations

## [1.0.47] - 2025-10-15 (Frontend) / Backend 1.0.18

### Added
- **New "Temporary" Role for Custom Participants**:
  - Custom event participants now created with "temporary" role (was "salesperson")
  - Same permissions as salesperson (Dashboard + Events only)
  - Role label: "Temporary Attendee"
  - Added to sandbox login credentials page
  - Username: derived from email, Password: "changeme123"

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Dev Dashboard Logout Issue**:
  - **Root cause:** Backend only allowed `admin` role, not `developer`
  - Route check was `if (req.user.role !== 'admin')` ‚Üí 403 Forbidden
  - 403 errors triggered unauthorized callback ‚Üí forced logout
  - **Solution:** Updated to `!== 'admin' && !== 'developer'`
  - Developer role now has proper access to dev dashboard

- **Login Redirect Loop**:
  - **Root cause:** Logout while on dev dashboard preserved page state
  - Next login tried to load dev dashboard ‚Üí immediate logout
  - Hard refresh was only way to recover
  - **Solution:** Reset `currentPage` to 'dashboard' on logout
  - Prevents redirect loops, always lands on dashboard after logout

### Backend Changes (v1.0.18)
- `routes/devDashboard.ts`:
  - Updated access control to allow admin OR developer role
  - Changed error message: "Admin or developer access required"
- `routes/events.ts`:
  - Custom participants created with 'temporary' role

### Frontend Changes
- `App.tsx`:
  - Added 'temporary' to `UserRole` type
  - Reset `currentPage` to 'dashboard' in `handleLogout()`
  - Reset `currentPage` in session timeout callback
- `layout/Sidebar.tsx`:
  - Added 'temporary' role to Dashboard and Events items
- `dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`:

- `auth/LoginForm.tsx`:
  - Added temporary attendee to sandbox credentials
- `events/EventSetup/hooks/useEventForm.ts`:
  - Changed custom participant role to 'temporary'
- `events/EventForm.tsx`:
  - Changed custom participant role to 'temporary'

### Impact

- ‚úÖ No more forced logout on dev dashboard
- ‚úÖ No more redirect loops after logout
- ‚úÖ Custom participants have appropriate limited access

## [1.0.46] - 2025-10-15 (Frontend) / Backend 1.0.17

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Session Manager Multiple Logout Notifications**:
  - 6 duplicate "Session Expired" notifications on timeout
  - Dev Dashboard causing forced logout
  - **Root cause:** `useAuth` hook's `logout` function not memoized
  - Every render created new function reference
  - `App.tsx` useEffect dependency on `logout` triggered session manager re-init
  - Each init added NEW event listeners without removing old ones
  - Multiple login/logout cycles stacked timers (2x, 3x, 4x...)
  - **Solution:** Wrapped `login` and `logout` with `useCallback`
  - Stable function references prevent unnecessary useEffect re-runs
  - Session manager now initializes once per actual login
  - Event listeners properly cleaned up on logout

- **Custom Participants Not Saving**:
  - Custom participants (like "test" user) not appearing after event creation
  - **Root cause:** Frontend generated UUID but only sent IDs to backend
  - Backend tried to insert non-existent user_id into event_participants table
  - Foreign key constraint failed, returned generic 500 error
  - **Solution:** Backend now accepts full participant objects
  - Checks if user exists in database
  - Creates user with default password "changeme123" if doesn't exist
  - Then adds to event_participants table

### Backend Changes (v1.0.17)
- `routes/events.ts`:
  - Accept `participants` array with full user objects (not just IDs)
  - Check if participant exists before insert
  - Auto-create users for custom participants (bcrypt password)
  - Added 'developer' role to event creation authorization
  - Fallback to old `participant_ids` format for compatibility

### Frontend Changes
- `hooks/useAuth.ts`:
  - Import `useCallback` from React
  - Wrap `login` and `logout` with `useCallback` for stable refs
  - Added `TokenManager.removeToken()` call on logout
- `components/events/EventSetup/hooks/useEventForm.ts`:
  - Changed `participant_ids` ‚Üí `participants` for create
  - Send full participant objects to backend
  - Kept old format for updates (compatibility)

### Impact
- ‚úÖ No more duplicate logout notifications
- ‚úÖ Dev Dashboard navigation works correctly
- ‚úÖ Session timer stable across all interactions
- ‚úÖ Custom participants saved successfully
- ‚úÖ Auto-user creation for event participants

### Notes
- Custom participants created with username derived from email
- Default password: "changeme123"
- Role: "salesperson" (can be overridden in payload)
- These users can then log in and change their password

## [1.0.45] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed
- **Event Creation UX Issues**:
  - Form didn't close after saving - user stuck on create page
  - Multiple clicks on "Create Event" created duplicate events
  - End date could be set before start date (no validation)

### Added
- **Duplicate Prevention for Event Creation**:
  - Button disabled while saving
  - Shows "Saving..." with spinner
  - Prevents spam clicks from creating multiple events
  - Same UX pattern as expense creation

- **Date Validation**:
  - End date must be >= start date
  - Browser-level validation (min attribute)
  - Visual error message if invalid date range
  - User-friendly red text warning

- **Better Error Handling**:
  - Try/catch wrapper around save operation
  - Alert shown if save fails
  - Form only closes on successful save
  - Proper cleanup with finally block

### Technical
- `EventSetup.tsx`:
  - Added `isSaving` state
  - Import `Loader2` icon
  - handleSubmit with duplicate prevention
  - Date field validation
  - Loading state on submit button

### Impact
- ‚úÖ No more duplicate events
- ‚úÖ Invalid date ranges prevented
- ‚úÖ Clear visual feedback
- ‚úÖ Better user experience

## [1.0.44] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed
- **Event Creation Failure with Custom Participants**:
  - "Create Event" button had no response (500 error)
  - Backend error: `invalid input syntax for type uuid: "1760544911767"`
  - **Root cause:** Custom participants used `Date.now().toString()` for ID generation
  - **Problem:** Database expects UUIDs, not timestamps
  - **Solution:** Use `generateUUID()` utility for proper UUID format
  - Event creation now works correctly with custom participants

### Technical
- `EventSetup/hooks/useEventForm.ts`:
  - Import `generateUUID` from utils
  - Replace `Date.now().toString()` with `generateUUID()`
- `EventForm.tsx`:
  - Import `generateUUID` from utils
  - Replace `Date.now().toString()` with `generateUUID()`

### Impact
- ‚úÖ Events with custom participants can be created
- ‚úÖ No more 500 errors from backend
- ‚úÖ Database validation passes
- ‚úÖ Proper UUID format for all participants

## [1.0.43] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Session Manager Event Listener Cleanup**:
  - **Root cause:** Event listeners never removed due to `bind(this)` creating new function references
  - **Consequence:** Multiple login/logout cycles stacked timers (2x, 3x, 4x...)
  - **Result:** Old timers fired early, causing premature logout
  - **Solution:** Store bound function reference once, use same reference for add/remove
  - Event listeners now properly removed on cleanup
  - No more duplicate timers stacking up
  - No more premature logouts

### Changed
- **Modern Event Listeners**:
  - Replaced deprecated `keypress` with `keydown` + `keyup`
  - Added `input` and `change` events for form field tracking
  - Added `touchmove` for better mobile support
  - Form typing now properly resets inactivity timer

### Technical
- `sessionManager.ts`:
  - Added `boundHandleActivity` property
  - Create bound reference once in `setupActivityListeners()`
  - Use same reference in `cleanup()` for removal
  - Call `cleanup()` in `init()` as safety check
  - Console log confirmation when listeners removed

### Impact
- ‚úÖ Timers no longer stack on multiple login cycles
- ‚úÖ Users won't be logged out prematurely
- ‚úÖ Form interactions properly tracked
- ‚úÖ Memory leaks prevented
- ‚úÖ Session timeout works correctly

## [1.0.42] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed
- **Session Timeout UX Improvements**:
  - Timer now shows actual remaining time (not hardcoded 15 minutes)
  - Fixed 5 duplicate logout notifications ‚Üí now shows only 1
  - Dismissing warning (X button) now resets timer properly
  - API calls now reset inactivity timer
  - Users won't be logged out during form submissions
  - Much smoother session timeout experience

### Technical
- `sessionManager.ts`:
  - Added `hasLoggedOut` flag to prevent duplicates
  - Reset flag in `init()` for fresh sessions
  - Reset `lastActivity` timestamp in `init()`
- `App.tsx`:
  - Initialize `timeRemaining` to 0 (calculated by sessionManager)
  - `handleDismissWarning()` now calls `sessionManager.dismissWarning()`
- `apiClient.ts`:
  - Import and notify `sessionManager` on every API request
  - Silently fail if session manager not initialized

### Impact
- ‚úÖ Accurate timer display
- ‚úÖ No duplicate notifications
- ‚úÖ Form submissions don't trigger logout
- ‚úÖ Improved user experience

## [1.0.41] - 2025-10-15

### Refactored

## [1.0.40] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed
- **Allow Unassigning Entities**:
  - User reported: selecting "Unassigned" didn't save
  - Previous fix prevented API call for empty entity (to avoid errors)
  - But this meant users couldn't unassign entities
  - **Solution:** Backend now accepts empty values (means "unassign")
  - Empty string ‚Üí database NULL value
  - Users can now change entity from "haute" ‚Üí "Unassigned" and vice versa

### Changed
- **Backend Entity Validation (v1.0.16)**:
  - Removed strict validation that rejected empty entities
  - Empty string converted to `undefined` (NULL in database)
  - `assignZohoEntity()` method updated
  - Comment added: "Empty string is allowed to 'unassign' an entity"

- **Frontend Entity Assignment (v1.0.40)**:
  - Removed skip logic for empty entity values
  - Always calls API, even when "Unassigned" selected
  - Works in both quick dropdown and edit modal

### Technical
- Backend: v1.0.15 ‚Üí v1.0.16
- Frontend: v1.0.39 ‚Üí v1.0.40
- Modified: `backend/src/services/ExpenseService.ts`
- Modified: `src/components/admin/Approvals.tsx` (2 functions)
- Database: zoho_entity field now accepts NULL

### Impact
- ‚úÖ Full bidirectional entity assignment/unassignment
- ‚úÖ Users can set entity back to "Unassigned"
- ‚úÖ No errors when selecting any option
- ‚úÖ Database properly stores NULL for unassigned

## [1.0.39] - 2025-10-15

### Added
- **Success Toast Notifications**:
  - Green toast appears when expense is saved: "‚úÖ Expense saved successfully!"
  - Shows "‚úÖ Expense updated successfully!" for edits
  - Provides immediate visual feedback to users
  - Complements existing error notifications

- **Duplicate Submission Prevention**:
  - Save button becomes disabled during processing
  - Shows loading spinner + "Saving..." text
  - Prevents spam-clicking the save button
  - Early return if already saving
  - Fixes issue where users created 10+ duplicate expenses

### Changed
- **Save Button UX Improvements**:
  - Button shows Loader2 spinner icon while saving

## [1.0.38] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Empty Entity Assignment Causing Update Failures**:
  - "Failed to update expense" error when selecting "Unassigned" entity
  - Root cause: Frontend sent empty string `""` to backend
  - Backend validation rejected: "Zoho entity name is required"
  - **Solution:** Skip API call when entity is empty/unassigned
  - Affects both quick entity dropdown and edit modal
  - Silent handling - no error, no API call, just skip

### Changed
- **Entity Assignment Validation**:
  - `handleAssignEntity()`: Check if entity is empty before API call
  - `handleSaveEdit()`: Added `editEntity.trim().length > 0` check
  - Selecting "Unassigned" no longer triggers backend error
  - Backend validation remains strict (security maintained)

### Technical
- Backend: v1.0.15 (no changes)
- Frontend: v1.0.37 ‚Üí v1.0.38
- Modified: `src/components/admin/Approvals.tsx` (2 functions updated)
- Better UX: Silent skip instead of confusing error message

## [1.0.37] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed

- Frontend: v1.0.36 ‚Üí v1.0.37 (removed toasts)
- Fixed: `backend/src/routes/users.ts` (lines 14, 28)
- Modified: `src/components/admin/Approvals.tsx` (removed success toasts)

## [1.0.35] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed
- **Misleading Toast Message in Approvals**:
  - When assigning entity, toast said "Expense is being pushed to Zoho Books..."
  - This workflow was removed months ago - expenses are now manually pushed from Reports page
  - Updated message to: "Go to Reports to push to Zoho Books" (correct workflow)
  - Affects both quick entity assignment and edit modal entity assignment

### Changed
- **Toast Messages**:
  - Real Zoho entities: "Entity assigned! Go to Reports to push to Zoho Books."
  - Mock entities: "Entity assigned! (Mock mode)"
  - Non-Zoho entities: "Entity assigned successfully" (unchanged)

### Technical
- Backend: v1.0.14 (no changes)

## [1.0.32] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed
- **"Unknown User" Bug in Approvals**:
  - Fixed issue where expenses showed "Unknown User" as submitter
  - Root cause: Backend was returning `user_name` via SQL JOINs, but frontend wasn't using it
  - Added `user_name` and `event_name` fields to Expense interface
  - Updated Approvals component to use pre-fetched data
  - Eliminated unnecessary user/event lookups in frontend

### Changed

  - All expense routes now use service layer
  - `POST /api/expenses` - Create expense
  - `PUT /api/expenses/:id` - Update expense
  - `PATCH /api/expenses/:id/review` - Approve/reject
  - `PATCH /api/expenses/:id/entity` - Assign Zoho entity
  - `PATCH /api/expenses/:id/reimbursement` - Update reimbursement status
  - `DELETE /api/expenses/:id` - Delete expense

  - Removed redundant "1 total" text from Active Events card
  - Dashboard cards now show only important information (number and title)
  - Cleaner, less cluttered UI

### Changed
- **Consistent Button Text for Zoho Push**:
  - Button always says "Push to Zoho" (not "Go to Reports")

  - Previously took users to general Reports page (requiring click on trade show to push)
  - Now navigates DIRECTLY to the event's detailed report with push button visible
  - Backend now provides event intelligence (which events have unsynced expenses)
  - If single event with unsynced items: goes directly to that event (button: "Push to Zoho")
  - If multiple events: goes to event with most unsynced items (button: "Go to Reports")
  - No extra clicks required - user lands exactly where they need to be!

### Changed
- Reports page now supports deep linking via URL hash (#event=123)
- Automatically selects and displays detailed report for specified event

  - Settings page detects `#users` hash and automatically opens User Management tab
  - Saves time and improves UX - no more scrolling or clicking required
  - Hash automatically syncs with manual tab switching for consistency

### Changed
- Settings tabs now update URL hash when manually switching
- System tab: clears hash
- User Management tab: sets #users hash
- Enables deep linking and browser back/forward navigation

  - "Hide" button collapses receipt completely (removes image entirely when hidden)
  - "View Full Size" button expands receipt when hidden
  - Much better UX - users can actually read receipt details
  - No more useless cropped preview that provided no information

### Removed
- Deleted `docs/SESSION_MANAGEMENT.md` (technical details can be referenced from code)

### Documentation
- Kept `BOOMIN_CREDENTIALS.md` separate (security best practice for sensitive credentials)
- Contains passwords, API keys, tokens that should NOT be in consolidated docs
