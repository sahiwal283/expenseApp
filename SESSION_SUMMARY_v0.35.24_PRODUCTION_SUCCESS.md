# Session Summary v0.35.24 - Production Deployment Success
**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Session Focus**: Complete production deployment and Zoho Books integration verification  
**Result**: ✅ **SUCCESSFUL** - Production app now fully operational with live Zoho Books API

---

## Executive Summary

This session achieved **full production deployment** of the expenseApp with working Zoho Books integration for Haute Brands. After resolving multiple configuration issues related to networking, database access, environment variables, and entity name resolution, the production app at `https://expapp.duckdns.org/` is now successfully pushing expenses to Zoho Books.

**Key Achievement**: First confirmed expense successfully pushed to Zoho Books in production environment.

---

## Starting State

- **Git Branch**: `v0.35.0`
- **Frontend Version**: 0.35.23
- **Backend Version**: 2.6.23
- **Environment**: 
  - Production Backend: Container 201 (192.168.1.201)
  - Production Frontend: Container 202 (192.168.1.xxx)
  - Sandbox Backend: Container 203 (192.168.1.144)
  - Nginx Proxy Manager: Container 104 (192.168.1.160)
  - Proxmox Host: 192.168.1.190

**Blockers at Start**:
- Production app login not working
- Expenses not being pushed to Zoho Books
- Port routing issues in Nginx configuration
- Entity name mismatch causing account resolution failures

---

## Major Issues Encountered & Resolutions

### Issue 1: Login Credentials Not Working
**Problem**: User unable to log in to production app with any credentials (admin/admin, admin/sandbox123, etc.)

**Root Cause**: Production backend (Container 201) was configured to use `expense_app_sandbox` database instead of the production `expense_app` database.

**Resolution**:
1. Updated Container 201's `/opt/expenseApp/backend/.env` to set `DB_NAME=expense_app`
2. Reset admin password in production database: `UPDATE users SET password = crypt('admin', gen_salt('bf')) WHERE username = 'admin';`
3. Restarted backend service

**Lesson**: Always verify database configuration matches the intended environment before deployment.

---

### Issue 2: 502 Bad Gateway on HTTPS Login
**Problem**: After fixing database, HTTPS endpoint returned 502 Bad Gateway while HTTP on port 3000 worked fine.

**Root Cause**: Nginx Proxy Manager (Caddy in Container 104) was configured to proxy backend requests to port **5000** instead of port **3000**.

**Resolution**:
1. User manually updated Nginx Proxy Manager configuration via web UI at 192.168.1.160
2. Changed both `/api` and `/api/uploads/` proxy targets from port 5000 to port 3000
3. No backend restart needed - issue resolved immediately

**Lesson**: When HTTP works but HTTPS doesn't, check the reverse proxy configuration layer (NPM/Caddy/Nginx) for port mismatches.

---

### Issue 3: Expenses Not Pushing to Zoho Books
**Problem**: User could log in and submit expenses, but they weren't appearing in Zoho Books. Backend logs showed: `[Zoho] Entity "Haute Brands" assigned, but no Zoho account configured (skipping sync)`

**Root Cause #1 - Missing Entity-Specific Credentials**: Environment had generic Zoho credentials (`ZOHO_CLIENT_ID`, `ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN`) but the multi-account service expects entity-prefixed variables (`ZOHO_HAUTE_CLIENT_ID`, `ZOHO_HAUTE_REFRESH_TOKEN`, etc.).

**Resolution for Root Cause #1**:
1. Added entity-specific environment variables to Container 201's `.env`:
```bash
ZOHO_HAUTE_CLIENT_ID=1000.6XS1OS32BX1BGKV25XDOIBWHSQN9VI
ZOHO_HAUTE_CLIENT_SECRET=3d9be2c0d9b132251c91bffacd01186b13a3f5a05a
ZOHO_HAUTE_REFRESH_TOKEN=1000.7e4e2b5188202a63b41db71745b82ab5.79add3219be6c28cbdd71e4f599997d6
ZOHO_HAUTE_ORGANIZATION_ID=856048585
ZOHO_HAUTE_EXPENSE_ACCOUNT_ID=5254962000000091094
ZOHO_HAUTE_PAID_THROUGH_ACCOUNT_ID=5254962000000129043
```
2. Restarted backend - logs showed account initialized
3. Still didn't work - same "no Zoho account configured" error

**Root Cause #2 - Entity Name Mismatch**: 
- Frontend UI shows "Haute Brands" as the entity name
- Database stores `zoho_entity = "Haute Brands"`
- Backend service registered account handler under key `"haute"` only
- When expense tagged with "Haute Brands", service looked for handler with key `"haute brands".toLowerCase()` → not found

**Resolution for Root Cause #2**:
Modified `backend/src/config/zohoAccounts.ts`:
```typescript
// OLD: Single registration
accounts.set('haute', {
  entityName: 'haute',
  // ...
});

// NEW: Dual registration for backward compatibility
const hauteConfig = {
  entityName: process.env.ZOHO_HAUTE_ENTITY_NAME || 'Haute Brands',
  // ...
};
accounts.set(hauteConfig.entityName.toLowerCase(), hauteConfig); // "haute brands"
if (hauteConfig.entityName.toLowerCase() !== 'haute') {
  accounts.set('haute', hauteConfig); // Also register as "haute"
}
```

**Final Verification**:
- Rebuilt backend: `npm run build`
- Deployed to production Container 201
- Backend logs confirmed: `[Zoho:MultiAccount] ✓ HAUTE BRANDS - REAL - Haute Brands`
- User tested expense submission → **SUCCESS** - appeared in Zoho Books

**Lessons**:
1. Multi-account services need entity-specific credential prefixes, not shared generic credentials
2. Entity names used in UI must match service registration keys (case-insensitive)
3. Environment variables should explicitly define entity display names to avoid hardcoded mismatches
4. Always test the full end-to-end flow after infrastructure changes

---

## Configuration Corrections Applied

### Backend Environment (`/opt/expenseApp/backend/.env` in Container 201)
**Key Changes**:
- ✅ `DB_NAME=expense_app` (was `expense_app_sandbox`)
- ✅ Added all `ZOHO_HAUTE_*` prefixed credentials
- ✅ Confirmed `ZOHO_HAUTE_ENABLED=true` and `ZOHO_HAUTE_MOCK=false`
- ✅ `ZOHO_HAUTE_ENTITY_NAME=Haute Brands` for proper UI matching

### Nginx Proxy Manager (Container 104)
**Corrected Proxy Configuration**:
- `/api` location: Backend set to `http://192.168.1.201:3000` (was `:5000`)
- `/api/uploads/` location: Backend set to `http://192.168.1.201:3000` (was `:5000`)

### Database (Production `expense_app`)
- Reset admin user password to `admin`
- Existing expenses with `zoho_entity = "Haute Brands"` now properly routed to Zoho service

---

## Deployment Summary

### Files Modified
1. `backend/src/config/zohoAccounts.ts` - Fixed entity name resolution
2. `package.json` - Version bump: 0.35.23 → 0.35.24
3. `backend/package.json` - Version bump: 2.6.23 → 2.6.24
4. Production `.env` file (Container 201) - Added entity-specific credentials and fixed DB_NAME

### Containers Updated
- **Container 201** (Production Backend): 
  - Deployed latest compiled backend code
  - Updated environment configuration
  - Service restarted and verified
  
### Services Restarted
- `expenseapp-backend.service` in Container 201 (multiple times during troubleshooting)

---

## What Went Wrong & Why

### Mistake 1: Initial Credential Deployment to Wrong Container
**What Happened**: Early in troubleshooting, I deployed production Zoho credentials to Container 203 (sandbox) instead of Container 201 (production).

**Why It Happened**: Confusion about container assignments due to user clarifying midway through that 201=production backend, 203=sandbox backend.

**Impact**: Wasted time, but no data corruption since sandbox was not actively used.

**Prevention Next Time**: 
- Always confirm container assignments at start of session
- Create a reference file (e.g., `CONTAINER_MAPPING.md`) in repo root
- Double-check target before any credential deployment

---

### Mistake 2: Didn't Catch Entity Name Mismatch Initially
**What Happened**: Added entity-specific credentials but didn't realize the entity name "Haute Brands" from UI wouldn't match service key "haute".

**Why It Happened**: 
- Assumed the multi-account service would normalize entity names automatically
- Didn't trace through the full code path from UI → database → service → handler lookup
- Backend startup logs said "✓ HAUTE - REAL" which seemed correct but didn't show the registered key

**Impact**: Required second code change and deployment after credentials were already added.

**Prevention Next Time**:
1. When debugging "not configured" errors, immediately check:
   - What value is stored in database (`SELECT zoho_entity FROM expenses`)
   - What keys are registered in service (`accountHandlers.keys()`)
   - Case sensitivity in lookup logic
2. Add debug logging to service initialization showing all registered keys
3. UI entity dropdown should ideally use entity "slug" (e.g., "haute") as value, display name (e.g., "Haute Brands") as label

---

### Mistake 3: Not Verifying Database Configuration First
**What Happened**: Spent time troubleshooting authentication before checking which database backend was connected to.

**Why It Happened**: Assumed production container would naturally use production database.

**Impact**: Extended troubleshooting time by ~10 minutes.

**Prevention Next Time**: 
- First step in any production deployment: verify `DB_NAME`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER` in active `.env`
- Add version/environment check endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/health`) that returns DB name, environment, version

---

## Technical Debt & Follow-ups

### Recommended Improvements

1. **Entity Configuration Consolidation**:
   - Current: Entity display names hardcoded in frontend, backend config, and database
   - Recommended: Single source of truth (database table `entities` with `slug` and `display_name`)
   - Benefit: Prevents name mismatch bugs

2. **Health Check Endpoint**:
   - Add `GET /api/health` endpoint returning:
     ```json
     {
       "version": "2.6.24",
       "environment": "production",
       "database": "expense_app",
       "zoho_accounts": ["haute brands"],
       "container_id": "201"
     }
     ```
   - Use for deployment verification

3. **Deployment Script Validation**:
   - Pre-deployment checks:
     - Container 201 is target for production
     - `.env` has `NODE_ENV=production`
     - `.env` has `DB_NAME=expense_app`
     - Zoho credentials present and non-empty
   - Post-deployment checks:
     - Backend responds to health check
     - Correct version reported
     - At least 1 Zoho account configured

4. **Container Assignment Documentation**:
   - Create `deployment/CONTAINER_MAPPING.md`:
     ```
     201 - Production Backend (192.168.1.201)
     202 - Production Frontend (192.168.1.xxx)
     203 - Sandbox Backend (192.168.1.144)
     204 - Sandbox Frontend (if needed)
     104 - Nginx Proxy Manager (192.168.1.160)
     ```

5. **Nginx Proxy Manager Config as Code**:
   - Current: Manual configuration via web UI
   - Issue: Changes not version-controlled, prone to manual errors
   - Recommended: Export NPM config to JSON, store in repo under `deployment/nginx-proxy-manager/`

## Lessons for Future AI Sessions

1. **Always verify container/environment mappings at session start** - Don't assume, confirm with user
2. **Check database configuration before authentication debugging** - Wrong DB is a common gotcha
3. **When "not configured" errors occur, trace the full lookup path** - Check what's stored vs what's expected
4. **Port mismatches often happen at reverse proxy layer** - If HTTP works but HTTPS doesn't, check NPM/Caddy/Nginx
5. **Entity-specific credentials need entity-specific prefixes** - Generic fallbacks can hide configuration issues
6. **Case-insensitive string matching requires explicit `.toLowerCase()`** - Don't rely on database or user input being consistent
7. **Backend startup logs are gold** - `[Zoho:MultiAccount] ✓ ENTITY - MODE - Name` tells you exactly what's configured
8. **Deploy, test, iterate quickly** - Don't overthink, deploy small changes fast
9. **User testing is the ultimate validation** - Logs can lie, but Zoho Books showing the expense is truth
