## 🔧 Merge Resolution Details

### Conflicts Resolved:

#### 1. `package.json` (version conflict)
- **Main:** v0.8.0
- **Sandbox:** v0.12.0
- **Resolution:** Bumped to **v0.13.0** (new merge baseline)

#### 2. `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` (version display)
- **Main:** Hardcoded `'0.8.0'`
- **Sandbox:** Dynamic `packageJson.version`
- **Resolution:** Kept sandbox's dynamic version (better practice)

#### 3. `src/utils/api.ts` (updateExpense method)
- **Main:** Added `receipt?: File` parameter with FormData upload
- **Sandbox:** Simple PUT without receipt support
- **Resolution:** Enhanced sandbox version to support receipt uploads using `apiClient.upload()` with PUT method

#### 4. `src/utils/apiClient.ts` (upload method)
- **Enhancement:** Modified `upload()` method to accept optional `method` parameter
- **Change:** `async upload(..., method: 'POST' | 'PUT' = 'POST')`
- **Benefit:** Now supports both POST (create) and PUT (update) uploads

#### 5. `src/components/expenses/ExpenseForm.tsx` & `ExpenseSubmission.tsx`
- **Resolution:** Accepted main's versions with Edit fixes
- **Reason:** These had critical bug fixes for Edit functionality

#### 6. Backup Files
- **Removed:** `ExpenseForm.tsx.backup`, `ExpenseSubmission.tsx.orig`
- **Reason:** These shouldn't be in version control
