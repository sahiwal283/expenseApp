## 🚨 User Impact & Communication

### What Users Will Notice

1. **On First Login After Deployment:**
   - Users will need to log in again (old 24h tokens invalid)
   - New session will have 15-minute inactivity timeout

2. **During Normal Use:**
   - No impact if actively using the app
   - Warning modal after 10 minutes of inactivity
   - Auto-logout after 15 minutes of inactivity

### Recommended Communication

**Email/Notification to Users:**
```
📢 Security Update: Enhanced Session Management

For your security, we've implemented automatic logout after 15 minutes of inactivity.

What this means:
• You'll receive a warning 5 minutes before logout
• Click "Stay Logged In" to continue your session
• Any activity (clicking, typing, scrolling) resets the timer
• Active users are not affected

This change enhances security by preventing unauthorized access to unattended sessions.
