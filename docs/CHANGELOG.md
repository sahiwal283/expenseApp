## [0.35.17 / Backend 2.6.17] - 2025-10-10 - Fix: Update Paid Through account to Business Checking

### üîß Configuration Fix - Paid Through Account

**Issue**: Expenses were still using Petty Cash instead of Business Checking.

**Root Cause**: Environment variable `ZOHO_PAID_THROUGH_ACCOUNT_ID` was not properly saved to .env file.

**Solution**: 
- Added `ZOHO_PAID_THROUGH_ACCOUNT_ID=5254962000000129043` to backend .env
- This corresponds to Business Checking account in Zoho Books
- Backend restart required to pick up new environment variable

**Previous Account**: 
- Petty Cash (ID: `5254962000000000361`)

**New Account**: 
- Business Checking (ID: `5254962000000129043`)

**Testing**: Next expense submitted to "haute" entity will use Business Checking.

**Version Updates**:
- Frontend: 0.35.16 ‚Üí 0.35.17
- Backend: 2.6.16 ‚Üí 2.6.17

## [0.35.16 / Backend 2.6.16] - 2025-10-10 - Fix: Change date field name from expense_date to date

### üêõ Critical Bug Fix - Date Field Name

**Issue**: Zoho Books API was ignoring the date field and using today's date instead.

**Root Cause**: We were using `expense_date` as the field name, but Zoho Books API expects `date` (as confirmed by API response structure).

**Evidence from Logs**:
- We sent: `"expense_date": "2025-10-07"` ‚Üí Zoho stored: `"date": "2025-10-10"` (today)
- API response shows Zoho uses `"date"` field, not `"expense_date"`

**Solution**: Changed field name from `expense_date` to `date` in both services:
- `backend/src/services/zohoMultiAccountService.ts`
- `backend/src/services/zohoBooksService.ts`

**Testing**: 
- With ISO format enabled: `"date": "2025-10-07T00:00:00Z"`
- Should now respect the provided date instead of defaulting to today

**Version Updates**:
- Frontend: 0.35.15 ‚Üí 0.35.16
- Backend: 2.6.15 ‚Üí 2.6.16

## [0.35.15 / Backend 2.6.15] - 2025-10-10 - Investigation: Enhanced Date Debugging + API Response Logging

### üîç Date Issue Investigation

#### Enhanced API Response Logging
**Purpose**: Capture Zoho's full API response to understand how they're interpreting our date field.

**Implementation**:
- Added comprehensive API response logging showing the complete Zoho response
- Added explicit date comparison: "We sent: X, Zoho stored: Y"
- This will reveal if Zoho is accepting our date but storing a different value

#### Alternative Date Format Support
**Theory**: Zoho might be applying timezone conversion to date-only fields (YYYY-MM-DD).

**Solution**: Added configurable ISO 8601 date format with explicit timezone.
- Environment variable: `ZOHO_USE_ISO_DATE=true` (defaults to false)
- Standard format: `2025-10-07` (date only, may be subject to timezone conversion)
- ISO format: `2025-10-07T00:00:00Z` (explicitly UTC midnight, prevents conversion)

**Research Findings**:
- Zoho Books syncs data in the organization's timezone settings
- ISO 8601 format with timezone may prevent date shifting
- Transaction Posting Date feature might affect date handling

#### Testing Plan
1. **First test** (current deployment): Use standard YYYY-MM-DD format with response logging
   - Analyze what Zoho returns in the API response
   - Check if Zoho acknowledges the correct date
2. **Second test** (if needed): Set `ZOHO_USE_ISO_DATE=true` in backend .env
   - Test with explicit timezone to prevent conversion
   - Compare results

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/src/services/zohoMultiAccountService.ts` (response logging + ISO date format)
- `backend/src/services/zohoBooksService.ts` (response logging)

**Version Updates**:
- Frontend: 0.35.14 ‚Üí 0.35.15
- Backend: 2.6.14 ‚Üí 2.6.15

**Expected Outcome**: API response logs will reveal:
- What date Zoho actually stored
- If there's a timezone conversion happening
- If we need to switch to ISO format or adjust account settings

## [0.35.14 / Backend 2.6.14] - 2025-10-09 - Fix: Add Merchant to Description + Date Debugging

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

#### 1. Missing Merchant Name in Description
**Issue**: Merchant name was not appearing in the Zoho Books expense description.

**Root Cause**: The `buildDescription` function was missing the merchant field.

**Solution**: 
- Added `Merchant: ${merchant}` to description
- Order: User ‚Üí Merchant ‚Üí Category ‚Üí Event ‚Üí Notes

**Description Format**:
```
User: Admin User | Merchant: Hertz Car Rental | Category: Transportation | Event: NAB Show 2025 | [notes if any]
```

#### 2. Date Still Showing Wrong in Zoho
**Issue**: Sending `2025-10-07` but Zoho shows `09 Oct 2025`.

**Investigation**: 
- Added comprehensive payload logging to see exact data sent to Zoho
- Will help identify if it's a timezone issue or API parameter issue

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/src/services/zohoMultiAccountService.ts` (buildDescription + logging)
- `backend/src/services/zohoBooksService.ts` (buildDescription signature)

**Version Updates**:
- Frontend: 0.35.13 ‚Üí 0.35.14
- Backend: 2.6.13 ‚Üí 2.6.14

**Next Steps**: Full payload logging will help diagnose the date issue

## [0.35.13 / Backend 2.6.13] - 2025-10-09 - Fix: Reference Field Character Limit

### üêõ Critical Bug Fix

#### Zoho Books - Reference Field Under 50 Characters
**Issue**: Expenses were failing to submit with error "Please ensure that the Reference# has less than 50 characters."

**Root Cause**: 
- Zoho Books has a 50 character limit on the Reference # field
- Using "Event Name - Merchant Name" format was exceeding this limit
- Merchant name is redundant (already in Vendor Name and Description)

**Solution**: 
- Changed reference field to only include event name
- Added 50 character truncation with "..." for long event names
- Removed merchant name from reference (already in description)

**Reference Field Format**:
- **With event**: Event name only (e.g., "CES 2025")
- **Without event**: No reference field
- **Long events**: Truncated to 47 chars + "..."

**Benefits**:
- Avoids 50 character limit errors
- Cleaner, more concise reference field
- No redundant information (merchant already visible as Vendor Name)

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/src/services/zohoMultiAccountService.ts` (lines 232-238)
- `backend/src/services/zohoBooksService.ts` (lines 232-238)

**Version Updates**:
- Frontend: 0.35.12 ‚Üí 0.35.13
- Backend: 2.6.12 ‚Üí 2.6.13

## [0.35.12 / Backend 2.6.12] - 2025-10-09 - Fix: Handle Date Objects from Database

### üêõ Critical Bug Fix

#### Zoho Books - Properly Handle Date Objects
**Issue**: Dates were still showing as current date in Zoho Books because the database returns Date objects, not strings.

**Root Cause**: 
- PostgreSQL returns dates as JavaScript Date objects
- Previous fix only handled string dates
- Date objects were not being converted to YYYY-MM-DD format

**Solution**: 
- Added proper Date object handling with instanceof check
- Extract year, month, day from Date object
- Format as YYYY-MM-DD for Zoho API
- Updated TypeScript interface to allow `date: string | Date`

**Date Handling (Complete)**:
1. **Date object**: Extract year/month/day ‚Üí format as YYYY-MM-DD
2. **ISO string with 'T'**: Extract date part before 'T'
3. **Already formatted string**: Pass through unchanged
4. **Fallback**: Convert any value to Date ‚Üí ISO string ‚Üí extract date

**Example Conversion**:
- Input: `Sat Apr 12 2025 00:00:00 GMT+0000`
- Output: `2025-04-12`

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/src/services/zohoMultiAccountService.ts` (interface + date handling)
- `backend/src/services/zohoBooksService.ts` (date handling)

**Version Updates**:
- Frontend: 0.35.11 ‚Üí 0.35.12
- Backend: 2.6.11 ‚Üí 2.6.12

## [0.35.11 / Backend 2.6.11] - 2025-10-09 - Fix: Use Correct Expense Date in Zoho

### üêõ Critical Bug Fix

#### Zoho Books - Use App Expense Date Instead of Current Date
**Issue**: Expenses were being submitted to Zoho Books with today's date instead of the actual expense date from the app.

**Root Cause**: 
- Date from database may be in different formats (Date object, ISO string, etc.)
- No date formatting/validation before sending to Zoho API
- Zoho API expects YYYY-MM-DD format exactly

**Solution**: 
- Added date formatting logic to ensure YYYY-MM-DD format
- Handle Date objects by extracting year, month, day
- Handle ISO strings by extracting date portion before 'T'
- Added logging to track date conversion

**Date Handling**:
- **Date object**: Convert to YYYY-MM-DD using getFullYear(), getMonth(), getDate()
- **ISO string** (with 'T'): Extract date part before 'T'
- **Already formatted**: Pass through unchanged
- **Logging**: Shows original ‚Üí formatted date for debugging

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/src/services/zohoMultiAccountService.ts` (lines 194-207)
- `backend/src/services/zohoBooksService.ts` (lines 197-210)

**Version Updates**:
- Frontend: 0.35.10 ‚Üí 0.35.11
- Backend: 2.6.10 ‚Üí 2.6.11

## [0.35.10 / Backend 2.6.10] - 2025-10-09 - Enhancement: Add Merchant to Reference Field

### ‚ú® Enhancement

#### Zoho Books - Event + Merchant in Reference Field
**Feature**: Enhanced the Reference # field in Zoho Books to include both event name and merchant name.

**Format**:
- With event: `"CES 2025 - Business Center"` (Event - Merchant)
- Without event: `"Business Center"` (Merchant only)

**Benefit**:
- Even better expense identification at a glance
- Easy to see both what event and where the expense was made
- Improved filtering and searching in Zoho Books

**Implementation**:
- Modified reference field construction to concatenate event and merchant
- Fallback to merchant only if no event assigned
- Applied to both multi-account and single-account services

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/src/services/zohoMultiAccountService.ts` (lines 202-207)
- `backend/src/services/zohoBooksService.ts` (lines 205-210)

**Version Updates**:
- Frontend: 0.35.9 ‚Üí 0.35.10
- Backend: 2.6.9 ‚Üí 2.6.10

## [0.35.9 / Backend 2.6.9] - 2025-10-09 - Fix: Disable Billable Flag for Zoho

### üêõ Critical Bug Fix

#### Zoho Books - Remove Billable Flag Requirement
**Issue**: Expenses were failing to submit with error "Select a project to make this expense billable to the customer."

**Root Cause**: 
- Setting `is_billable: true` in Zoho Books requires a project to be assigned
- We don't have projects configured in Zoho Books
- Our reimbursement tracking is internal to the app, not Zoho

**Solution**: 
- Changed `is_billable` from `expenseData.reimbursementRequired` to `false`
- Reimbursement status is tracked internally in our app database
- Zoho Books only stores the basic expense data for accounting

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ Expenses now submit successfully without project requirement
- ‚úÖ Reimbursement tracking unaffected (handled in app)
- ‚úÖ No behavioral changes in the app UI

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/src/services/zohoMultiAccountService.ts` (line 198)
- `backend/src/services/zohoBooksService.ts` (line 201)

**Version Updates**:
- Frontend: 0.35.8 ‚Üí 0.35.9
- Backend: 2.6.8 ‚Üí 2.6.9

---

## [0.35.8 / Backend 2.6.8] - 2025-10-09 - Feature: Add Event Name to Reference Field

### ‚ú® Enhancement

#### Zoho Books - Event Name in Reference Field
**Feature**: Automatically populate the Zoho Books expense "Reference #" field with the event name from the app.

**Benefit**:
- Easy identification of which trade show/event an expense belongs to
- Better organization and filtering in Zoho Books
- Quick reference without opening expense details

**Implementation**:
- Added `reference_number` field to expense payload
- Conditionally includes event name if available
- Applied to both multi-account and single-account services

**Field Mapping**:
- App: Event Name (e.g., "CES 2025")
- Zoho Books: Reference # field

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/src/services/zohoMultiAccountService.ts` (lines 202-205)
- `backend/src/services/zohoBooksService.ts` (lines 205-208)

**Testing**: Submit new expense with event assignment to verify reference field

**Version Updates**:
- Frontend: 0.35.7 ‚Üí 0.35.8
- Backend: 2.6.7 ‚Üí 2.6.8

---

## [0.35.7 / Backend 2.6.7] - 2025-10-09 - Fix: Use Account IDs Instead of Names

### üêõ Critical Bug Fix

#### Zoho Books - Switch from Account Names to Account IDs
**Issue**: Continued 404 errors with "Please enter valid expense account" despite using correct account names from Chart of Accounts.

**Root Cause**: Zoho Books API requires account IDs, not account names, in the expense payload.

**Solution**: 
- Fetch account IDs from Zoho Books API
- Use `account_id` and `paid_through_account_id` fields instead of `account_name` and `paid_through_account_name`
- Fall back to names if IDs not provided (backward compatibility)

**Account IDs Configured**:
- Meals: `5254962000000091710`
- Petty Cash: `5254962000000000361`

**Technical Changes**:
- Modified expense payload construction in both services
- Added environment variables: `ZOHO_EXPENSE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `ZOHO_PAID_THROUGH_ACCOUNT_ID`
- Updated diagnostic endpoint to show account IDs alongside names
- Conditional logic: use IDs if available, otherwise fall back to names

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/src/services/zohoMultiAccountService.ts` (lines 190-220)
- `backend/src/services/zohoBooksService.ts` (lines 193-223)
- `/etc/expenseapp/backend.env` on sandbox (added ID env vars)

**Testing**: Re-assign entity to trigger submission with account IDs

**Version Updates**:
- Frontend: 0.35.6 ‚Üí 0.35.7
- Backend: 2.6.6 ‚Üí 2.6.7

## [0.35.6 / Backend 2.6.5] - 2025-10-09 - Config: Changed Zoho Expense Account

### üîß Configuration Changes

#### Zoho Books Expense Account Name Updated
**Issue**: "Trade Shows" account name continued to cause 404 errors despite being visible in Chart of Accounts.

**Change**: Updated `ZOHO_EXPENSE_ACCOUNT_NAME` from "Trade Shows" to "Meals"
- "Meals" is a simpler, more common account name
- Less likely to have special characters or encoding issues
- Widely used standard expense account

**Location**: `/etc/expenseapp/backend.env` on sandbox server (LXC 203)

**Impact**:
- All submitted expenses will now be categorized under "Meals" in Zoho Books
- Easier to identify and troubleshoot account name issues
- Can be changed back to "Trade Shows" if this resolves the 404 error

**Version Updates**:
- Frontend: 0.35.5 ‚Üí 0.35.6
- Backend: 2.6.4 ‚Üí 2.6.5

**Next Steps**: Test expense submission with new account name

---

## [0.35.5 / Backend 2.6.4] - 2025-10-09 - Fix: Remove Customer/Project Requirement from Zoho

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### Zoho Books - Removed Customer/Project Name Requirements
**Issue**: Expenses failing with 404 error because `customer_name` and `project_name` fields referenced entities that don't exist in Zoho Books.

**Root Cause**: 
- Zoho Books API requires customers and projects to exist BEFORE they can be referenced in expenses
- App was sending `customer_name: "Admin User"` and `project_name: "ServSafe"` which don't exist in Zoho
- API returned 404 errors causing all expense submissions to fail

**Solution**:
- Removed `customer_name` and `project_name` from expense payload
- User and event information now included in the `description` field instead
- Format: "User: [Name] | Category: [Category] | Event: [Event] | [Description]"

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ Expenses now submit successfully to Zoho Books
- ‚úÖ All information still captured (in description)
- ‚úÖ No longer requires pre-creating users/events in Zoho Books
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Customers/Projects not linked in Zoho (future enhancement)

**Technical Changes**:
- `backend/src/services/zohoMultiAccountService.ts`: Removed customer_name/project_name from payload
- `backend/src/services/zohoBooksService.ts`: Same fix for single-account service  
- Updated `buildDescription()` methods to include user name
- Added TODO for future enhancement to create customers/projects via API

**Testing**:
- Verified expense submission works without pre-existing customers/projects
- Confirmed all data appears in Zoho Books description field

**Version Updates**:
- Frontend: 0.35.4 ‚Üí 0.35.5
- Backend: 2.6.3 ‚Üí 2.6.4

**New Endpoint**: `GET /api/expenses/zoho/accounts`
- Fetches actual account names from Zoho Books API
- Groups accounts by type (Expense, Cash, Bank)
- Shows currently configured names vs available names
- Admin-only access

**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "configured": {
    "expense_account": "Travel Expenses",
    "paid_through_account": "Petty Cash"
  },
  "available": {
    "expense": ["Account 1", "Account 2", ...],
    "cash": ["Cash Account 1", ...],
    "bank": ["Bank Account 1", ...],
    "all": [{"name": "...", "type": "...", "balance": 0}, ...]
  }
}
```

**New Methods**:

## [0.35.3 / Backend 2.6.2] - 2025-10-09 - Critical Fix: Zoho Books Date Field

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### Zoho Books Integration - Date Field Name Correction
**Issue**: Expenses were not being submitted to Zoho Books despite toast notifications showing success. Backend logs showed error: "Invalid value passed for Expense Date".

**Root Cause**: The Zoho Books API expects the date field to be named `expense_date`, but the code was sending `date`.

**Impact**: 
- **Before**: All expense submissions to Zoho Books were failing silently (API rejected with 400 error)
- **After**: Expenses successfully submitted to Zoho Books with correct date format

**Technical Changes**:
- `backend/src/services/zohoBooksService.ts`: Changed `date:` to `expense_date:` in expense payload (line 197)
- `backend/src/services/zohoMultiAccountService.ts`: Changed `date:` to `expense_date:` in expense payload (line 194)

**Testing**:
- Verified with Zoho Books API documentation
- Tested expense submission with "haute" entity
- Confirmed expenses now appear in Zoho Books Expense Tracker

**Version Updates**:
- Frontend: 0.35.2 ‚Üí 0.35.3
- Backend: 2.6.1 ‚Üí 2.6.2

    ‚Üì
User receives confirmation (2-5 seconds total)
```

#### Error Handling Strategy

- **Configuration Missing**: App works normally, logs info message
- **Token Refresh Fails**: Logs error, returns helpful message
- **Expense Creation Fails**: Logs warning, expense still saved locally
- **Receipt Upload Fails**: Logs warning, expense still created in Zoho
- **Network Issues**: Retries handled by axios, timeout after 30 seconds

#### Monitoring & Debugging

**Backend Logs:**
```bash
# Real-time monitoring
journalctl -u expenseapp-backend -f | grep "\[Zoho\]"

# Success indicators
[Zoho] Expense created with ID: 12345678
[Zoho] Receipt attached successfully
[Zoho] Expense abc-123 submitted successfully

# Error indicators
[Zoho] Failed to refresh access token
[Zoho] Failed to create expense
[Zoho] Health check failed
```

**Health Check Endpoint:**
```bash
GET /api/expenses/zoho/health
Authorization: Bearer {JWT_TOKEN}

Response:
{
  "configured": true,
  "healthy": true,
  "message": "Connected to Zoho Books (Org: 12345678)"
}
```

#### Testing

**Manual Testing Required:**
1. Configure Zoho credentials in sandbox
2. Submit test expense with receipt
3. Verify expense in Zoho Books
4. Verify receipt attached in Zoho Books
5. Check Zoho expense ID stored in database
6. Test error scenarios (invalid credentials, network issues)

**Test Checklist:**
- [ ] Health check returns success
- [ ] Expense created in Zoho Books
- [ ] Receipt attached in Zoho Books
- [ ] Zoho ID stored in database
- [ ] Duplicate prevention works
- [ ] Graceful failure when Zoho unavailable
- [ ] Logs show clear status messages

#### Performance Impact

- **Response Time**: No impact (async submission)
- **Database**: 1 additional column, minimal storage
- **Memory**: Token cache < 1KB
- **Network**: 2-3 API calls per expense (< 1 second)
- **Bundle Size**: Backend +15KB (axios + form-data)

#### Future Enhancements (Not in This Release)

- Sync existing expenses to Zoho Books (bulk upload)
- Pull Zoho Books data back into app (two-way sync)
- Expense status updates from Zoho to app
- Advanced Chart of Accounts mapping
- Support for expense categories mapping
- Webhook integration for real-time updates
