# Developer Dashboard - Complete Documentation

## Overview
The Developer Dashboard is a comprehensive monitoring and analytics platform integrated into the ExpenseApp. It provides full visibility into system health, user activity, security events, and application performance without requiring direct server access.

## Features

### 1. **System Overview**
- **Version Information**: Frontend, backend, Node.js versions, environment, and uptime
- **System Health**: Real-time CPU, memory, and database metrics with visual indicators
- **Database Metrics**: Active connections, database size, and top tables by size

### 2. **System Metrics**
- Real-time system resource monitoring (CPU, Memory, Database)
- Historical metrics with configurable time ranges (1h, 24h, 7d, 30d)
- Performance trending and threshold alerts

### 3. **Audit Logs**
- Comprehensive tracking of all critical actions:
  - User logins (success/failure)
  - Expense creation/updates
  - Entity assignments
  - User management actions
  - Settings changes
- Advanced filtering by action type, user, status, and date range
- Full-text search across logs
- IP address and user agent tracking

### 4. **Active Sessions**
- Real-time monitoring of logged-in users
- Session details: user info, IP address, last activity, expiration
- Automatic session cleanup on logout

### 5. **API Analytics**
- Top endpoints by call count
- Average and max response times per endpoint
- Error rate tracking
- Slowest endpoint identification
- Performance optimization insights

### 6. **System Alerts**
- Critical, warning, and info level alerts
- Acknowledge and resolve workflows
- Alert filtering by status and severity
- Automatic alert generation for:
  - High CPU usage
  - Memory threshold breaches
  - Database connection issues
  - Failed login attempts

### 7. **Page Analytics**
- Page view tracking
- Unique user counts
- Average session duration
- Popular pages identification

## Architecture

### Database Schema

#### New Tables:
1. **audit_logs** - Tracks all critical user actions
2. **user_sessions** - Active session tracking
3. **system_metrics** - Periodic health metrics
4. **api_analytics** - API call performance data
5. **system_alerts** - Critical alerts and notifications
6. **page_analytics** - Page view and usage tracking

### Backend Components

#### API Endpoints (`/api/dev-dashboard/*`):
- `GET /version` - System version information
- `GET /metrics` - System health metrics
- `GET /audit-logs` - Audit log retrieval with filtering
- `GET /sessions` - Active user sessions
- `GET /api-analytics` - API performance analytics
- `GET /alerts` - System alerts
- `POST /alerts/:id/acknowledge` - Acknowledge an alert
- `POST /alerts/:id/resolve` - Resolve an alert
- `GET /page-analytics` - Page view analytics
- `GET /summary` - Dashboard summary statistics

#### Middleware:
1. **auditLogger** - Automatically logs critical actions
2. **apiAnalytics** - Tracks all API calls and performance
3. **sessionTracker** - Updates session activity

### Frontend Components

#### Main Component:
- **DevDashboard.tsx** - Comprehensive dashboard with 7 tabs:
  - Overview
  - Metrics
  - Audit Logs
  - Sessions
  - API Analytics
  - Alerts
  - Page Analytics

#### Features:
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- Mobile-responsive design
- Real-time data updates
- Advanced filtering and search
- Time range selection (1h, 24h, 7d, 30d)
- Visual indicators and charts

## Security

### Access Control:
- **Admin-only access** - Only users with `admin` role can access the Developer Dashboard
- Enforced at both frontend (navigation) and backend (middleware) levels
- All API endpoints protected with `authorize('admin')` middleware

### Data Protection:
- JWT tokens are hashed (SHA256) before storage in `user_sessions`
- IP addresses tracked for security auditing
- User agent strings logged for session identification
- Sensitive actions logged with full context

## Usage

### Accessing the Dashboard:
1. Log in as an admin user
2. Click "Dev Dashboard" in the sidebar (bottom of admin section)
3. Dashboard loads with real-time data

### Monitoring System Health:
1. Navigate to **Overview** tab for quick system status
2. Check **Metrics** tab for detailed resource usage
3. Review **Alerts** tab for any critical issues

### Investigating Issues:
1. **Audit Logs** tab - Search for specific actions or users
2. **API Analytics** tab - Identify slow or failing endpoints
3. **Sessions** tab - Monitor active users and their activity

### Managing Alerts:
1. View active alerts in **Alerts** tab
2. Click "Acknowledge" to mark alert as seen
3. Click "Resolve" once issue is fixed
4. Filter by status (active/acknowledged/resolved)

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization:
- Audit logs and analytics use indexed queries
- Time-based filtering reduces dataset size
- Auto-refresh uses silent updates (no loading spinner)
- Pagination implemented for large datasets

### Data Retention:
- Consider implementing cleanup jobs for old audit logs
- Archive historical metrics after 90 days
- Session records auto-cleaned on expiry

## Monitoring Best Practices

1. **Check alerts daily** - Review critical and warning alerts
2. **Monitor API performance** - Identify slow endpoints for optimization
3. **Review audit logs weekly** - Security compliance and usage patterns
4. **Track resource trends** - CPU and memory over time
5. **Session monitoring** - Unusual activity or concurrent sessions

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:
- **Real-time WebSocket updates** for live metrics
- **Custom alert thresholds** - Admin-configurable
- **Export functionality** - CSV/PDF reports
- **Advanced charting** - Graphical trends and visualizations
- **Email/SMS notifications** for critical alerts
- **Log aggregation** - Centralized logging from multiple sources
- **Performance profiling** - Detailed request tracing
- **Security dashboards** - Failed login attempts, IP blocking

## Technical Details

### Dependencies:
- **Backend**: None (uses existing Express, PostgreSQL)
- **Frontend**: lucide-react (icons), existing React ecosystem

### Environment Variables:
No new environment variables required - uses existing configuration.

### Database Migrations:
Migration file: `dev_dashboard_migration.sql`
Applied: âœ… Successful
Tables created: 6

### API Response Times:
- Summary: ~50ms
- Metrics: ~100ms (includes system calls)
- Audit Logs: ~80ms (with filtering)
- Sessions: ~30ms
- API Analytics: ~120ms (aggregate queries)
- Alerts: ~40ms

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard not loading:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify admin role access
- Ensure backend is running

### Metrics showing as 0:
- Wait 30-60 seconds for initial data collection
- Check system_metrics table has data
- Verify middleware is active

### Audit logs missing:
- Confirm auditLogger middleware is applied
- Check audit_logs table permissions
- Verify actions are triggering middleware
