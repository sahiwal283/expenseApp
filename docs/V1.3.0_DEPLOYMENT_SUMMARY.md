## 🎯 Major Feature: Unified Expense & Approval Workflows

### What Changed?

**Before (v1.1.14):**
- Separate "Expenses" tab → Submit and view own expenses
- Separate "Approvals" tab → Approve expenses, assign entities, push to Zoho
- Two different pages with duplicated functionality

**After (v1.3.0):**
- **Single "Expenses" tab** → All functionality in one place
- **Smart conditional rendering** based on user role:
  - **Regular users** (salesperson, coordinator, temporary): See only their own expenses (unchanged)
  - **Approval users** (admin, accountant, developer): See all expenses + approval features

---

## 🆕 New Features (Admin/Accountant/Developer Only)

### 1. Approval Workflow Cards
Three summary cards displayed at the top of the Expenses page:
- **Pending Approval**: Count + total amount of expenses awaiting approval
- **Reimbursements**: Count of reimbursements pending approval  
- **Unassigned Entities**: Count of expenses needing entity assignment

### 2. Enhanced Expense Table
Three new columns (visible only to approval users):
- **User**: Shows who submitted the expense
- **Entity**: Dropdown to assign/change Zoho entity
- **Zoho**: Button to push to Zoho Books (shows "Pushed" status after successful push)

### 3. Inline Approval Actions
- **Approve/Reject** buttons for pending expenses (directly in Actions column)
- **Reimbursement Approve/Reject** buttons for pending reimbursements (in Reimbursement column)
