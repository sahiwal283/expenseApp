# Frontend Testing Guide

**Version: 0.5.0-alpha (Pre-release)**

This guide focuses on testing the frontend React application independently, without requiring backend setup.

## Quick Start (Easiest Way)

## Known Limitations (Pre-release)

This is a frontend-only pre-release with the following limitations:

1. **No Real Backend**: Data stored in browser localStorage
2. **No OCR Processing**: Receipt OCR is simulated
3. **No Email Notifications**: Not implemented yet
4. **No File Storage**: Receipt files not actually uploaded
5. **No User Authentication**: Login simulated client-side
6. **Data Not Shared**: Each browser has separate data
7. **No Zoho Integration**: Placeholder only

## Troubleshooting

**For detailed troubleshooting, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)**

### npm: command not found

If you get this error, Node.js is not installed. See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#npm-command-not-found) for installation instructions.

### Port Already in Use
If port 5173 is in use, edit `vite.config.ts`:
```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    port: 3000  // or any other port
  }
})
```

### Dependencies Installation Failed
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Page Won't Load
1. Check console for errors (F12)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Data Not Persisting
1. Check browser localStorage is enabled
2. Open DevTools > Application > Local Storage
3. Verify data is being saved

### UI Not Displaying Correctly
