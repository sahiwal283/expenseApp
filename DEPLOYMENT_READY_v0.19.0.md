## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. Inline Column Filters

| Column | Filter Type | Functionality |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Date** | Date Picker | Select specific date |
| **Event** | Dropdown | Filter by trade show event |
| **Category** | Dropdown | Filter by expense category |
| **Merchant** | Text Input | Search merchant names (partial match) |
| **Amount** | Min/Max Inputs | Range filtering |
| **Card Used** | Dropdown | Filter by payment card |
| **Receipt** | N/A | Visual column only |
| **Status** | Dropdown | Pending/Approved/Rejected |
| **Reimbursement** | Dropdown | Required/Not Required |

### 2. Column Reordering

**Before:**
```
Date → Merchant → Category → Card Used → Amount → Status → Reimbursement → Receipt → Event → Actions
```

**After:**
```
Date → Event → Category → Merchant → Amount → Card Used → Receipt → Status → Reimbursement → Actions
```

**Why?**
- **Date & Event first**: Provides temporal and contextual information upfront
- **Category & Merchant**: What was purchased
- **Amount & Card**: Financial details grouped together
- **Status & Reimbursement**: Workflow review information at the end

### 3. UX Enhancements

- **Active Filter Indicator**: "Clear Filters" button only appears when filters are active
- **Dual-Row Header**: Clean separation of column labels and filter inputs
- **Smart Dropdowns**: Automatically populated from actual expense data
- **Instant Filtering**: No page reload, real-time results
- **Combined Filtering**: All filters work together (AND logic)

## 🔒 Production Safety

### Current Status

**Sandbox:** Ready for deployment ✅  
**Production:** **NOT AFFECTED** ✅

### Why Production is Safe

1. **Separate Branch**: Feature is on `feature/expense-table-column-filtering`, NOT on `main`
2. **No Main Branch Changes**: Production pulls from `main` branch only
3. **Explicit Deployment Required**: Production won't get this until:
   - Sandbox testing complete
   - Pull Request created
   - Code review approved
   - Merge to main
   - Manual deployment to production

### When to Deploy to Production

**Only deploy when ALL criteria met:**
- [ ] Sandbox testing complete with zero critical issues
- [ ] All regression tests passed
- [ ] User feedback positive
- [ ] Performance validated with realistic data
- [ ] Browser compatibility confirmed (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified
- [ ] Explicit stakeholder approval received

## 💡 Feature Highlights for Users

### Before This Feature

- Only global search box for merchant/description
- Two dropdowns for status and event filtering
- Limited filtering capabilities
- Had to scroll through many expenses to find specific ones

### After This Feature

- **9 independent filters** (one per column)
- **Powerful combinations** (filter by event + category + amount range + status)
- **Intuitive UX** (filters right in column headers)
- **Faster data discovery** (find specific expenses in seconds)
- **Better analysis** (easily spot trends, outliers, issues)

### Real-World Examples

**Example 1: Find Expensive Hotel Stays**
- Category: Select "Hotels"
- Amount Min: Enter "200"
- Result: All hotel expenses ≥ $200

**Example 2: Review Pending CES Expenses**
- Event: Select "CES 2025"
- Status: Select "Pending"
- Result: All pending expenses from CES 2025

**Example 3: Check Hertz Rental Charges**
- Merchant: Type "hertz"
- Result: All Hertz-related expenses

**Example 4: Find Reimbursable Personal Card Charges**
- Card: Select "Personal Card"
- Reimbursement: Select "Required"
- Result: All personal card expenses requiring reimbursement

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Current Limitations (By Design)

1. **Receipt Column**: No filter (visual-only column)
2. **Date Filter**: Single date only (no range picker yet)
3. **Location**: Not filterable (covered by merchant search)
4. **Description**: Not in merchant search (could add later)

### Potential Future Enhancements

- Date range filter (from-to dates)
- Multi-select filters (multiple events/categories)
- Save filter presets
- Export filtered data to CSV
- Filter history/recent filters
- Full-text search across all fields
