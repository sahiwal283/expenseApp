## üéØ Step 1: Get Authorization Code

**Click this link** (or copy/paste into browser):

```

```

**What will happen:**
1. Zoho will ask you to log in (use nabeelhpe@gmail.com)
2. Zoho will ask you to authorize the app
3. You'll be redirected to: `https://expapp.duckdns.org/auth/zoho/callback?code=XXXXXXXXXX`
4. **Copy the entire URL** from your browser's address bar

## üéØ Step 2: Exchange Code for Refresh Token

Once you have the code, run this command (replace `YOUR_CODE_HERE` with the actual code):

```bash
curl -X POST https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/token \
  -d "client_id=1000.6XS1OS32BX1BGKV25XDOIBWHSQN9VI" \
  -d "client_secret=3d9be2c0d9b132251c91bffacd01186b13a3f5a05a" \
  -d "code=YOUR_CODE_HERE" \
  -d "grant_type=authorization_code" \
  -d "redirect_uri=https://expapp.duckdns.org/auth/zoho/callback"
```

**The response will contain your refresh_token** - copy it!
