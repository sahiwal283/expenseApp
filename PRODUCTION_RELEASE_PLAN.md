## üîß Environment Separation

### Critical: Sandbox vs Production APIs

**Current State**: 
- Sandbox environment fully functional
- Using test Zoho Books API for "haute" entity
- Mock APIs for alpha, beta, gamma, delta entities

**Production Requirements**:
- **MUST** use separate environment files
- **MUST** use different API credentials
- **MUST** use different database
- **MUST NOT** reuse sandbox credentials in production

### Environment File Locations

**Sandbox**:
- Backend env: `/etc/expenseapp/backend.env` (Container 203)
- Database: `expenseapp_sandbox`

**Production** (TO BE CONFIGURED):
- Backend env: `/etc/expenseapp-prod/backend.env` (Container TBD)
- Database: `expenseapp_production`

## üèóÔ∏è Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Create Production Environment (MANUAL - After Credentials Received)

1. **Create Production LXC Container**
   ```bash
   # On Proxmox host (192.168.1.190)
   pct create <container_id> <template> \
     --hostname expense-production \
     --memory 4096 \
     --cores 2 \
     --rootfs local-lvm:20 \
     --net0 name=eth0,bridge=vmbr0,ip=dhcp
   ```

2. **Set Up Production Database**
   ```bash
   # Inside production container
   bash /path/to/deployment/postgres/setup-postgres.sh
   # Create expenseapp_production database
   # Run migrations from backend/src/database/schema.sql
   ```

3. **Configure Production Environment File**
   ```bash
   # Create /etc/expenseapp-prod/backend.env with production credentials
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/expenseapp-prod
   sudo nano /etc/expenseapp-prod/backend.env
   # Paste production credentials (provided by you)
   ```

### Phase 2: Merge to Main Branch

1. **Switch to main branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Merge v0.35.0 feature branch**
   ```bash
   git merge v0.35.0 --no-ff -m "Release v0.35.20: Zoho Books integration complete"
   ```

3. **Tag the release**
   ```bash
   git tag -a v0.35.20 -m "Production Release v0.35.20

   Features:
   - Complete Zoho Books API integration
   - Multi-entity support (real + mock)
   - Automatic expense submission with receipts
   - Date, merchant, and paid-through account handling
   
   Critical Fixes:
   - Date field name correction (date vs expense_date)
   - Environment file configuration (systemd EnvironmentFile)
   - Merchant name in description
   - Business Checking paid-through account"
   
   git push origin main
   git push origin v0.35.20
   ```

### Phase 3: Deploy to Production

1. **Pull code to production container**
   ```bash
   ssh root@192.168.1.190
   pct exec <prod_container_id> -- bash -c 'cd /opt/expenseapp && git checkout main && git pull origin main'
   ```

2. **Install dependencies and build backend**
   ```bash
   pct exec <prod_container_id> -- bash -c 'cd /opt/expenseapp/backend && npm ci --production && npm run build'
   ```

3. **Update systemd service to use production env file**
   ```bash
   # Edit /etc/systemd/system/expenseapp-backend.service
   # Change: EnvironmentFile=/etc/expenseapp-prod/backend.env
   systemctl daemon-reload
   systemctl restart expenseapp-backend
   ```

4. **Build and deploy frontend**
   ```bash
   pct exec <prod_container_id> -- bash -c 'cd /opt/expenseapp && npm ci && npm run build && rm -rf /var/www/html/* && cp -r dist/* /var/www/html/'
   ```

5. **Verify deployment**
   ```bash
   # Check backend status
   systemctl status expenseapp-backend
   
   # Check backend version
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/health | jq .version
   
   # Check frontend version
   curl http://localhost/index.html | grep -o 'v[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+'
   ```

### Phase 4: Validation & Monitoring

1. **Check logs for errors**
   ```bash
   journalctl -u expenseapp-backend -f
   ```

2. **Test critical endpoints**
   ```bash
   # Health check
   curl https://api.expenseapp.yourdomain.com/api/health
   
   # Zoho health check
   curl https://api.expenseapp.yourdomain.com/api/expenses/zoho/health
   ```

3. **Test expense submission workflow**
   - Log into production frontend
   - Create test expense
   - Upload receipt
   - Submit for approval
   - Assign to entity with Zoho integration
   - Verify in Zoho Books

4. **Monitor for 24 hours**
   - Check error logs
   - Verify all integrations working
   - Monitor database connections
   - Check API response times

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

### If Issues Arise During Deployment:

1. **Immediate Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Stop production services
   systemctl stop expenseapp-backend
   
   # Switch to previous stable version
   cd /opt/expenseapp
   git checkout <previous_stable_tag>
   
   # Rebuild and restart
   cd backend && npm run build
   systemctl start expenseapp-backend
   ```

2. **Database Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Restore from backup if schema changes were made
   pg_restore -d expenseapp_production /path/to/backup.dump
   ```

3. **Notify Users**
   - Update status page
   - Send notification if applicable
   - Document incident
