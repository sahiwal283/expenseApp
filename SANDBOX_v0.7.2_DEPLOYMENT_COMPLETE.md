**Solution:**
```typescript
const loadData = async () => {
  const [ev, ex, us, st] = await Promise.all([
    api.getEvents(),
    api.getExpenses(),  // Fresh data from server
    api.getUsers(),
    api.getSettings()
  ]);
  setExpenses(ex || []);  // Update state
};

const handleAssignEntity = async (expense, entity) => {
  await api.assignEntity(expense.id, { zoho_entity: entity });
  await loadData();  // Reload all data
};
```

**Result:** UI updates immediately after assignment ✅
