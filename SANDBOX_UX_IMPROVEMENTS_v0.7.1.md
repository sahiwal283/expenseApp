---

## 📋 Summary

This release includes critical UX improvements and bug fixes for the sandbox environment. All changes are sandbox-only and ready for testing before production deployment.

**Version Updates:**

- Backend: `1.1.0` → `1.1.1`

---

## ✨ Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Login Page - Sandbox Credentials Display

**Issue:** The login page showed generic "demo accounts" that didn't match the actual sandbox credentials.

**Fix:** 
- Updated login page to display actual sandbox test accounts
- Changed from generic usernames (admin/admin, sarah/password) to actual sandbox credentials (admin/sandbox123, etc.)
- Added all 5 sandbox test accounts with clear labeling
- Improved visual design with better formatting and password badges

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx`

**Impact:** Users can now immediately see and use the correct sandbox credentials without confusion.

**Before:**
```
Demo Accounts:
- admin / admin (Admin)
- sarah / password (Show Coordinator)
```

**After:**
```
Sandbox Test Accounts:
- admin / sandbox123 (Administrator)
- coordinator / sandbox123 (Event Coordinator)
- salesperson / sandbox123 (Salesperson)
- accountant / sandbox123 (Accountant)
- salesperson2 / sandbox123 (Salesperson)
```

### 2. ✅ Expense Form - Location Field Removed

**Issue:** Users were confused by the "Location" field on the expense submission form.

**Fix:**
- Removed the manual "Location" input field from the expense submission form
- Location can still be populated automatically via OCR if present in the receipt
- Simplified the form layout to reduce user confusion

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/expenses/ExpenseForm.tsx` (lines 411-422 removed)

**Impact:** Cleaner, more user-friendly expense submission form with fewer unnecessary fields.

---

### 3. ✅ Receipt Saving Bug - Fixed

**Issue:** Uploaded receipts were not being saved or linked to expense entries. Files were processed by OCR but never persisted in the database.

**Root Cause:**
- Receipt file was collected in `ExpenseForm` but never passed to the API
- `handleSaveExpense` in `ExpenseSubmission` wasn't receiving or forwarding the receipt file
- Backend endpoint was ready to receive files, but frontend wasn't sending them

**Fix:**
- Updated `ExpenseForm` interface to accept receipt file parameter in `onSave` callback
- Modified `handleSaveExpense` to receive and forward receipt file to API
- Added receipt file to API call: `api.createExpense(data, receiptFile)`
- Added proper file handling for both server and local storage modes

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/expenses/ExpenseForm.tsx` (interface and handleSubmit)
- `src/components/expenses/ExpenseSubmission.tsx` (handleSaveExpense function)
- `src/utils/api.ts` (already had support, just needed to be used)

**Impact:** Receipt files now properly upload, save, and link to expenses. Users can view uploaded receipts on expense details.

**Technical Details:**
```typescript
// ExpenseForm.tsx
interface ExpenseFormProps {
  ...
  onSave: (expense: Omit<Expense, 'id'>, receiptFile?: File | null) => void;
}

// ExpenseSubmission.tsx
const handleSaveExpense = async (expenseData, receiptFile?: File | null) => {
  await api.createExpense(data, receiptFile || undefined);
}
```

### 4. ✅ Notification Bell - Red Dot Fixed

**Issue:** The notification bell's red dot indicator always showed, even after viewing notifications. It never disappeared, causing users to think they always had unread notifications.

**Fix:**
- Added `hasViewedNotifications` state to track when user opens notification panel
- Added `previousNotificationCount` state to detect new notifications
- Red dot now only shows when there are notifications AND they haven't been viewed
- Red dot reappears when new notifications arrive
- Added pulse animation for better visibility

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`

**Impact:** Notification indicator now correctly reflects unread status. Users can tell at a glance if they have new notifications.

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
const [hasViewedNotifications, setHasViewedNotifications] = useState(false);
const [previousNotificationCount, setPreviousNotificationCount] = useState(0);

// Reset viewed flag if new notifications arrive
if (pending.length > previousNotificationCount) {
  setHasViewedNotifications(false);
}

// Mark as viewed when opening the panel
const handleNotificationClick = () => {
  setShowNotifications(!showNotifications);
  if (!showNotifications) {
    setHasViewedNotifications(true);
  }
};

const hasUnreadNotifications = notifications.length > 0 && !hasViewedNotifications;
```

### 5. ✅ Accountant Dashboard - Summary Cards Added

**Issue:** Accountants didn't see the same summary cards (Total Expenses, Approved, Pending, Entities) that admins saw on their reports page.

**Fix:**
- Updated `AccountantDashboard` summary cards to match admin format exactly
- Changed from custom metrics to standard: Total Expenses, Approved, Pending, Entities
- Added transaction counts and percentage calculations
- Made visual styling consistent with admin dashboard

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/accountant/AccountantDashboard.tsx`

**Impact:** Accountants now have the same high-level overview as admins, improving consistency and UX.

**Cards Displayed:**
1. **Total Expenses** - Total amount with transaction count
2. **Approved** - Approved amount with percentage of total
3. **Pending** - Pending amount with item count
4. **Entities** - Count of active entity mappings

---

### 6. ✅ Entity Assignment - Fixed and Improved

**Issue:** Assigning a Zoho entity to an expense didn't work. The dropdown would change but the assignment wouldn't save, and the UI wouldn't update.

**Root Cause:**
- Frontend was using generic `api.updateExpense()` instead of dedicated entity assignment endpoint
- Backend had proper `/expenses/:id/entity` PATCH endpoint, but no corresponding API function in frontend
- Error handling was missing, so failures were silent

**Fix:**
- Added `assignEntity` function to API client
- Updated `handleAssignEntity` to use dedicated endpoint
- Added try/catch error handling with user feedback
- Improved data flow: API call → parent refresh → UI update

**Files Modified:**
- `src/utils/api.ts` (added `assignEntity` function)
- `src/components/accountant/AccountantDashboard.tsx` (updated handler with error handling)

**Impact:** Entity assignments now work correctly. UI updates immediately and changes persist. Users see error messages if assignment fails.

**New API Function:**
```typescript
assignEntity: async (id: string, payload: { zoho_entity: string }) => 
  apiFetch(`/expenses/${id}/entity`, { method: 'PATCH', body: JSON.stringify(payload) })
```

---

### 7. ✅ Approval System - Already Implemented

**Status:** The accountant dashboard already had a clear approval/reimbursement system with:
- Visual approve/reject buttons for pending expenses
- Separate reimbursement approval buttons
- Clear status indicators
- Comprehensive filtering options

**No Changes Needed:** This was already well-implemented.

---

## 📊 Technical Details

### Database Changes
- None required (all changes are frontend/backend logic only)

### API Changes
- **New Endpoint Usage:** `PATCH /api/expenses/:id/entity` (existing endpoint, now properly used)
- **Modified:** Receipt file upload now properly forwarded in `POST /api/expenses`

### Frontend Components Modified

2. `src/components/expenses/ExpenseForm.tsx`
3. `src/components/expenses/ExpenseSubmission.tsx`
4. `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`
