## üìù Implementation Details

### Code Changes

**File**: `backend/src/config/zohoAccounts.ts`
- Added Boomin Brands configuration block (lines 54-75)
- Follows same pattern as Haute Brands
- Dual registration: both "boomin brands" and "boomin" keys

**Pattern Used**:
```typescript
const boominConfig = {
  entityName: process.env.ZOHO_BOOMIN_ENTITY_NAME || 'Boomin Brands',
  enabled: true,
  mock: process.env.ZOHO_BOOMIN_MOCK === 'true',
  clientId: process.env.ZOHO_BOOMIN_CLIENT_ID || '',
  // ... other credentials
};
accounts.set(boominConfig.entityName.toLowerCase(), boominConfig);
if (boominConfig.entityName.toLowerCase() !== 'boomin') {
  accounts.set('boomin', boominConfig);
}
```

### Environment Variables Added
