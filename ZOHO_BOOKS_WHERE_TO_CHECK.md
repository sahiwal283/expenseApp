## üìã **Verifying ExpenseApp ‚Üí Zoho Sync**

### **What to Check:**

After assigning an entity to "haute" in ExpenseApp:

1. **Wait 2-5 seconds** (sync is nearly instant)
2. **Refresh Zoho Books** (press F5 or click refresh)
3. **Check for new expense** at the top of the list
4. **Verify details match:**
   - ‚úÖ Vendor = Merchant from ExpenseApp
   - ‚úÖ Amount = Expense amount
   - ‚úÖ Date = Expense date
   - ‚úÖ Customer = User who submitted
   - ‚úÖ Project = Trade show event
   - ‚úÖ Receipt = Uploaded file (if any)

### **Troubleshooting:**

**If you don't see the expense:**

1. **Check toast notification** - Did it say "pushed to Zoho Books"?
2. **Check backend logs:**
   ```bash
   ssh root@192.168.1.190
   pct exec 203 -- journalctl -u expenseapp-backend -n 50 | grep Zoho
   ```
   Look for:
   ```
   [Zoho:haute:REAL] Expense created with ID: 12345678
   [Zoho:haute:REAL] Receipt attached successfully
   ```
3. **Check database for Zoho ID:**
   ```bash
   pct exec 203 -- su - postgres -c "psql -d expense_app_sandbox -c \"SELECT merchant, amount, zoho_entity, zoho_expense_id FROM expenses WHERE zoho_entity = 'haute' ORDER BY submitted_at DESC LIMIT 5;\""
   ```
4. **Verify Zoho health:**
   - Login to sandbox: http://192.168.1.144/
   - Test the health check endpoint

**If receipt is missing:**
- Check if file was uploaded in ExpenseApp
- Check file size (< 5MB limit)
- Check backend logs for receipt attachment errors
