- **Performance:** Moderate accuracy, slower processing
- **Issues:** Limited accuracy on real-world receipts, poor handling of varied layouts

## Evaluation Criteria
1. **Accuracy** on real-world receipts (skewed, noisy, varied fonts)
2. **Multi-language support**
3. **Speed** (processing time)
4. **Integration** complexity with Node.js backend
5. **Cost** (must be free/open-source)
6. **Maintenance** and community support

## OCR Solutions Evaluated

- ✅ **Robust layout detection** - handles rotated, skewed images
- ✅ **Strong preprocessing** - built-in image enhancement
- ✅ **Active development** - maintained by Baidu with large community
- ✅ **Completely free** and open-source
- ✅ **Production-ready** - used by thousands of companies

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Python-based (requires Python microservice for Node.js integration)
- ⚠️ Larger model size (~100MB)

**Integration:** Python microservice with HTTP API

### 2. EasyOCR
**Pros:**
- ✅ Good accuracy (85-90%)
- ✅ 80+ languages
- ✅ Easy to use
- ✅ Free and open-source

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Slower than PaddleOCR (2-3x)
- ⚠️ Less accurate on complex layouts
- ⚠️ Python-based (same integration challenge)
- ⚠️ Larger model downloads

**Integration:** Python microservice with HTTP API

### 3. Tesseract (Current)
**Pros:**
- ✅ Already integrated
- ✅ JavaScript native (tesseract.js)
- ✅ No additional services needed

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Poor accuracy** on real-world receipts (60-70%)
- ❌ **Struggles with** skewed images, varied fonts, noise
- ❌ **Slower processing** with preprocessing
- ❌ **Limited layout understanding**
- ❌ **Manual preprocessing required** (Sharp)

### 4. Google Cloud Vision API
**Pros:**
- ✅ Excellent accuracy (95%+)
- ✅ Fast
- ✅ Well-documented

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Not free** ($1.50 per 1,000 images after free tier)
- ❌ External dependency
- ❌ Privacy concerns (data sent to Google)

### 5. docTR (Document Text Recognition)
**Pros:**
- ✅ Good accuracy (85%)
- ✅ Modern architecture
- ✅ Free and open-source

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Less mature than PaddleOCR
- ⚠️ Smaller community
- ⚠️ Python-based

## Decision: PaddleOCR

### Rationale
After evaluating all options, **PaddleOCR** is the clear winner for the following reasons:

1. **Superior Accuracy:** 95%+ accuracy on real-world receipts vs 60-70% with Tesseract
2. **Production-Proven:** Used by major companies and has 40k+ GitHub stars
3. **Speed:** 200-500ms processing time (acceptable for receipt uploads)
4. **Robust:** Handles skewed, rotated, noisy images without extensive preprocessing
5. **Multi-language:** Native support for 80+ languages out of the box
6. **Free:** Completely open-source with no usage limits
7. **Active Development:** Regular updates and strong community support

│   - Returns structured data         │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Implementation Plan

1. **Install PaddleOCR** in sandbox Python environment
2. **Create FastAPI microservice** for OCR processing
3. **Configure as systemd service** for reliability
4. **Update Node.js backend** to call OCR service instead of Tesseract
5. **Remove Tesseract.js** and dependencies
6. **Test end-to-end** receipt workflow
7. **Document** configuration and deployment

### Performance Expectations

- **Processing Time:** 200-500ms per receipt (vs 1-2s with Tesseract)
- **Accuracy:** 95%+ (vs 60-70% with Tesseract)
- **Memory:** ~500MB for OCR service (acceptable)
- **CPU:** Light (can run on same container)

## Conclusion

**PaddleOCR is the optimal choice** for replacing Tesseract in the expenseApp. Despite requiring a Python microservice, the dramatic improvements in accuracy, speed, and robustness make it the best solution for production-quality receipt OCR.
