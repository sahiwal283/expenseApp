## Local Development Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sahiwal283/expenseApp.git
cd expenseApp
```

### 2. Database Setup

Install and start PostgreSQL:

```bash
# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install postgresql@14
brew services start postgresql@14

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

Create the database:

```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL
psql postgres

# Create database and user
CREATE DATABASE expense_app;
CREATE USER expense_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_secure_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE expense_app TO expense_user;
\q
```

### 3. Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:

   ```bash
cd backend
   npm install
   ```

Create environment configuration:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` file with your configuration:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=expense_app
DB_USER=expense_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password

# JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET=your_random_secret_key_min_32_chars_long

# File Upload
UPLOAD_DIR=uploads
MAX_FILE_SIZE=5242880
```

Run database migrations:

```bash
npm run migrate
```

Seed the database with demo data:

```bash
npm run seed
```

Demo users created:
- `admin` / `password123` (Admin)
- `sarah` / `password123` (Coordinator)
- `mike` / `password123` (Salesperson)
- `lisa` / `password123` (Accountant)

Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

### 4. Frontend Setup

Open a new terminal and install dependencies:

```bash
cd ..  # Return to project root
npm install
```

Start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## OCR Receipt Scanning Feature

The application includes automatic OCR text extraction from uploaded receipts using Tesseract.js.

### How it Works

1. Users upload a receipt image (JPEG, PNG, or PDF) when submitting expenses
2. The backend processes the image using Tesseract.js OCR
3. Extracted text is stored in the database with the expense
4. OCR text can be used for searching and verification

### Supported Formats
- JPEG/JPG
- PNG
- PDF

### File Size Limit
- Maximum 5MB per file (configurable via MAX_FILE_SIZE)

## Role-Based Permissions

### Admin
- Full system access
- User management
- All event and expense operations
- System settings configuration

### Coordinator
- Create and manage events
- View all expenses for their events
- Assign participants to events

### Salesperson
- Submit expenses for assigned events
- View their own expenses
- Upload receipts

### Accountant
- View all expenses
- Approve/reject expenses
- Assign Zoho entities
- Approve/reject reimbursements
- Access financial reports

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify PostgreSQL is running: `pg_isready`
- Check .env credentials
- Ensure database exists: `psql -l | grep expense_app`

### OCR Not Working
- Check file format is valid (JPEG, PNG, PDF)
- Ensure Tesseract.js dependencies are installed
- Check server logs for errors

### Port Already in Use
- Change PORT in backend .env
- Change Vite port in vite.config.ts

## Production Deployment

For production:
1. Set NODE_ENV=production
2. Use strong JWT_SECRET
3. Configure production PostgreSQL
4. Enable HTTPS/SSL
5. Set up proper CORS policies
6. Configure automated database backups
