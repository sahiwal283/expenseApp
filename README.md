## üìö Zoho Books Integration

### Overview

Every expense submitted through the app is **automatically posted to Zoho Books** with its receipt attachment. This eliminates manual data entry and ensures your accounting system stays in sync with your expense tracking.

### Key Capabilities

‚úÖ **Automatic Submission** - Expenses sync to Zoho Books immediately upon submission  
‚úÖ **Receipt Attachments** - Uploaded receipts are automatically attached in Zoho Books  
‚úÖ **Duplicate Prevention** - Smart tracking prevents re-submission of the same expense  
‚úÖ **Error Handling** - Graceful fallback if Zoho Books is unavailable (expenses still saved locally)  
‚úÖ **Reimbursement Tracking** - Billable/reimbursable expenses flagged appropriately  
‚úÖ **Event/Project Mapping** - Trade shows mapped to Zoho Books projects  
‚úÖ **OAuth 2.0 Security** - Industry-standard authentication with automatic token refresh  

### How It Works

```
1. User submits expense with receipt ‚Üí 
2. Expense saved to local database ‚Üí 
3. OCR processes receipt ‚Üí 
4. Expense automatically posted to Zoho Books ‚Üí
5. Receipt attached to Zoho Books expense ‚Üí
6. Zoho expense ID stored for tracking ‚Üí
7. User sees confirmation (all happens in seconds!)
```

### Setup

**Quick Setup:** Follow our comprehensive setup guide:
- üìñ **[docs/ZOHO_BOOKS_SETUP.md](docs/ZOHO_BOOKS_SETUP.md)** - Complete step-by-step instructions

**Environment Variables Required:**
```bash
ZOHO_CLIENT_ID=1000.YOUR_CLIENT_ID
ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN=1000.your_refresh_token
ZOHO_ORGANIZATION_ID=12345678
ZOHO_EXPENSE_ACCOUNT_NAME=Travel Expenses
ZOHO_PAID_THROUGH_ACCOUNT=Petty Cash
```

**Health Check:**
```bash
GET /api/expenses/zoho/health
```

### Optional Integration

The Zoho Books integration is **completely optional**:
- ‚úÖ If configured: Expenses sync automatically
- ‚úÖ If not configured: App works normally (local storage only)
- ‚úÖ No disruption: Integration failure won't block expense submission

### Security

üîí **No credentials in code** - All secrets stored in environment variables  
üîí **Token auto-refresh** - Access tokens refresh automatically (no user action needed)  
üîí **Secure OAuth 2.0** - Industry-standard authentication flow  
üîí **Audit trail** - All Zoho API interactions logged for debugging

## Local Development Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sahiwal283/expenseApp.git
cd expenseApp
```

### 2. Database Setup

Install and start PostgreSQL:

```bash
# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install postgresql@14
brew services start postgresql@14

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

Create the database:

```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL
psql postgres

# Create database and user
CREATE DATABASE expense_app;
CREATE USER expense_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_secure_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE expense_app TO expense_user;
\q
```

### 3. Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:

   ```bash
cd backend
   npm install
   ```

Create environment configuration:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` file with your configuration:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=expense_app
DB_USER=expense_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password

# JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET=your_random_secret_key_min_32_chars_long

# File Upload
UPLOAD_DIR=uploads
MAX_FILE_SIZE=5242880
```

Run database migrations:

```bash
npm run migrate
```

Seed the database with demo data:

```bash
npm run seed
```

Demo users created:
- `admin` / `password123` (Admin)
- `sarah` / `password123` (Coordinator)
- `mike` / `password123` (Salesperson)
- `lisa` / `password123` (Accountant)

Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

### 4. Frontend Setup

Open a new terminal and install dependencies:

```bash
cd ..  # Return to project root
npm install
```

Start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## OCR Receipt Scanning Feature

The application includes automatic OCR text extraction from uploaded receipts using Tesseract.js.

### How it Works

1. Users upload a receipt image (JPEG, PNG, or PDF) when submitting expenses
2. The backend processes the image using Tesseract.js OCR
3. Extracted text is stored in the database with the expense
4. OCR text can be used for searching and verification

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

- Ensure Tesseract.js dependencies are installed
- Check server logs for errors

### Port Already in Use
- Change PORT in backend .env
- Change Vite port in vite.config.ts

## Production Deployment

For production:
1. Set NODE_ENV=production
2. Use strong JWT_SECRET
3. Configure production PostgreSQL
4. Enable HTTPS/SSL
5. Set up proper CORS policies
