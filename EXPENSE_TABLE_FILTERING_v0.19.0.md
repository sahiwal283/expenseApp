# Expense Table Column Filtering Feature - v0.19.0

**Feature Branch:** `sandbox-v0.19.0`  
**Created:** October 8, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for Sandbox Deployment  
**Production Status:** üö´ Do NOT deploy to production yet

---

## üéØ Feature Overview

This update enhances the Expense Management table with powerful inline column filtering capabilities, making it much easier for users to find and analyze specific expenses.

### What's New

#### 1. **Inline Column Filtering** üîç
Every column in the expense table now has its own filter input directly in the table header:

| Column | Filter Type | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Date** | Date Picker | Select specific date to filter expenses |
| **Event** | Dropdown | Filter by specific trade show events |
| **Category** | Dropdown | Filter by expense categories (Flights, Hotels, Meals, etc.) |
| **Merchant** | Text Search | Search for merchant names (partial matching) |
| **Amount** | Min/Max Range | Set minimum and maximum amount filters |
| **Card Used** | Dropdown | Filter by payment card type |
| **Receipt** | N/A | No filter (visual column only) |
| **Status** | Dropdown | Filter by pending/approved/rejected |
| **Reimbursement** | Dropdown | Filter by required/not required |

#### 2. **Column Reordering** üìä
Columns reorganized for better workflow:

**Old Order:**  
Date ‚Üí Merchant ‚Üí Category ‚Üí Card Used ‚Üí Amount ‚Üí Status ‚Üí Reimbursement ‚Üí Receipt ‚Üí Event

**New Order:**  
Date ‚Üí Event ‚Üí Category ‚Üí Merchant ‚Üí Amount ‚Üí Card Used ‚Üí Receipt ‚Üí Status ‚Üí Reimbursement

**Why?**
- Date and Event first = better context for when and where expense occurred
- Category and Merchant grouped = what was purchased
- Amount and Card grouped = financial details
- Status and Reimbursement at end = workflow review

#### 3. **Enhanced UX Features** ‚ú®
- **Clear Filters Button**: One-click reset of all active filters
- **Active Filter Indicator**: Button only appears when filters are active
- **Dual-Row Header**: Clean separation of column labels and filter inputs
- **Smart Dropdowns**: Dynamically populated with actual data from expenses
- **Amount Range**: Min/max inputs for precise amount filtering

- Amount Min: Enter "200"
- Result: Only hotel expenses ‚â• $200 displayed

**Scenario 2: View pending expenses from CES 2025**
- Event: Select "CES 2025"
- Status: Select "Pending"
- Result: Only pending expenses from CES 2025

**Scenario 3: Search for Hertz rental charges**
- Merchant: Type "hertz"

## üöÄ Sandbox Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
- SSH access to Proxmox server (192.168.1.190)
- Access to sandbox container (203)
- GitHub access to pull the feature branch

### Step-by-Step Deployment

```bash
# 1. SSH into Proxmox server
ssh root@192.168.1.190

# 2. Access sandbox container
pct exec 203 -- bash

# 3. Navigate to application directory
cd /opt/expenseapp

# 4. Check current branch
git branch

# 5. Fetch latest changes from GitHub
git fetch origin

# 6. Checkout the feature branch
git checkout sandbox-v0.19.0

# 7. Pull latest changes (ensure you have the latest)
git pull origin feature/expense-table-column-filtering

# 8. Install any new dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# 9. Build the frontend
npm run build

# 10. Copy build to dist (if not automatic)
# The build should already be in /opt/expenseapp/dist

# 11. Restart frontend service (if using systemd)
# OR just refresh the browser if serving from dist directory

# 12. Verify the build
ls -la dist/

# 13. Check version in built files
grep -r "0.19.0" dist/

# 14. Exit container
exit
```

### Verification Steps

After deployment, test the following in sandbox:

1. **Login** as any test user (admin/sandbox123)
2. **Navigate** to Expense Management
3. **Verify column order**: Date, Event, Category, Merchant, Amount, Card Used, Receipt, Status, Reimbursement
4. **Test date filter**: Select a date, verify filtering works
5. **Test event filter**: Select an event, verify filtering works
6. **Test category filter**: Select a category, verify filtering works
7. **Test merchant search**: Type partial merchant name, verify search works
8. **Test amount range**: Enter min/max amounts, verify range filtering
9. **Test combined filters**: Apply multiple filters simultaneously
10. **Test Clear Filters**: Click button, verify all filters reset
11. **Check responsiveness**: Resize browser, ensure table remains usable
12. **Test with different roles**: Login as admin, coordinator, salesperson, accountant

### Expected Results

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Receipt Column**: No filter available (by design - visual column only)
2. **Location Data**: Not included in filtering (merchant filter covers this partially)
3. **Description Field**: Not included in merchant search (could be added later)
4. **Date Range**: Single date filter only (no "from-to" range yet)

### Potential Enhancements (Future)

- **Date Range Filter**: Start and end date pickers
- **Multi-Select Filters**: Select multiple events or categories
- **Save Filter Presets**: Save commonly used filter combinations
- **Export Filtered Data**: Download filtered expenses as CSV
- **Filter History**: Recently used filter combinations
- **Advanced Search**: Full-text search across all fields

## üìä Performance Considerations

### Expected Performance

| Data Volume | Filter Time | User Experience |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| <50 expenses | <50ms | Instant |
| 50-200 expenses | 50-200ms | Very fast |
| 200-1000 expenses | 200-500ms | Fast |
| >1000 expenses | 500ms+ | May notice delay |

### Optimization Notes

- All filtering done client-side (no API calls)
- Filters applied simultaneously in single pass
- No debouncing on text inputs (instant feedback)
- Dropdowns populated once on component mount
- Minimal re-renders with proper React state management

## üí° User Guide (For Documentation)

### How to Use Column Filters

**Basic Filtering:**
1. Navigate to Expense Management page
2. Locate the filter row directly below column headers
3. Choose a filter input for the column you want to filter
4. Enter your filter criteria
5. Table updates automatically

**Combining Filters:**
1. Apply first filter (e.g., select event)
2. Apply additional filters (e.g., select category, enter amount min)
3. All filters work together (AND logic)
4. Only expenses matching ALL criteria are shown

**Clearing Filters:**
- **Option 1**: Manually reset each filter input
- **Option 2**: Click "Clear Filters" button (appears in top-right when filters active)

**Tips:**
- Start with broad filters (event, category) then narrow down
- Use amount range to find expenses in specific price ranges
- Merchant search is case-insensitive and finds partial matches
- Combine status and reimbursement filters for workflow management

## üìû Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Filters not working**
- **Check**: Browser console for errors
- **Solution**: Refresh page, clear browser cache

**Issue: Data not showing**
- **Check**: Are filters active? Look for "Clear Filters" button
- **Solution**: Click "Clear Filters" or reset individual filters

**Issue: Dropdown empty**
- **Check**: Are there expenses with that data?
- **Solution**: Add expenses first, or check different filter

**Issue: Amount filter not working**
- **Check**: Valid number format (no commas, just digits and decimal)
- **Solution**: Enter amounts like "100" or "250.50"

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check sandbox version
curl http://192.168.1.144:5000/api/health

# View sandbox logs
pct exec 203 -- journalctl -u expenseapp-backend -n 50

# Check frontend files
pct exec 203 -- ls -la /opt/expenseapp/dist/

# Verify build
pct exec 203 -- grep "0.19.0" /opt/expenseapp/dist/assets/*.js
```

---

## üì¶ Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered in sandbox:

```bash
# SSH to Proxmox
ssh root@192.168.1.190

# Access sandbox
pct exec 203 -- bash

# Navigate to app
cd /opt/expenseapp

# Checkout previous version (main or sandbox branch)
git checkout main  # or git checkout sandbox

# Rebuild
npm run build

# Restart services if needed
